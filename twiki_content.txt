---+!! Review of TOP-15-018: Measurement of the ttbar AFB at 13Tev in boosted/resolved l+jets

%TOC{title="Contents:"}%

---++ Introduction

This analysis is a template measurement of the top quark forward backward asymmetry and anomalous chromoelectric/chromomagnetic moments in boosted and resolved l+jets events using the full 2016 dataset from CMS and the LHC. Our CADI line is TOP-15-018 ([[cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines?line=TOP-15-018&tp=an&id=1550&ancode=TOP-15-018][link]]), and we have a review hypernews ([[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018.html][link]]).

   * Theory discussion could be better organized in the first few pages; maybe omit eqs. 6/7 for example.
   * Iron out use of jargon and be sure to define terms at first use ("muon events", "boosted events", "templating", etc.)
   * Add discussion of approximate overall trigger efficiencies and how they were measured
   * Section 8 and Table 1: add quantitative ranges for uncertainty sources
   * Give general QCD transfer factor values and discuss dependence on observables
   * Mention that WJets background uncertainty SF applies to +/- charged events overall, not separately
   * Results section should focus more on description of results as opposed to technical details of the fit
   * L8: reword to avoid using "top production"
   * L11-12: give expected proportion of contribution from each process
   * L14: add reference
   * Figure 12: Clarify if bottom right plot shows only qqbar initial states or if gg events are included; also improve the quality of the bottom right figure, and mention that they come from gen-level top kinematics.
   * Figure 2 caption: remove last sentence (already in text)
   * Figure 2 and everywhere in text: "M" --> "m_{ttbar}" to disambiguate
   * L64-65: "Standard Model" --> "SM"
   * L88: change from "i,j" since they're already used in eq. 3; also define j
   * Eq. 4: explain this by connecting it to eq. 2. Related to the two parts of the xsec having c^2- and c-dependent contributions only?
   * Eq. 6: c^* in denominator
   * L120-129: good place to say what's novel about this analysis w.r.t. previous LHC work; maybe bring stuff from L38-39 down here instead.
   * L128-129: second and third topologies not well motivated. Reader wonders why bother?
   * L147: remove photon measurement description as it's not relevant to our analysis
   * L157: repeats L148
   * L162: "Muons are identified"
   * L157-158: information here poorly structured: lepton momentum resolution info is unnecessary. Trigger efficiencies should be elsewhere. Reco/ID efficiencies only given for muons.
   * L173-174: pT_miss in PV selection and ETmiss in the event are not the same
   * L190: "of any muons whose singular PF candidates it shares" ambiguous.
   * L202-207: move this to the end of section 2, around L144
   * L250: cut at 50GeV for boosted electrons channels is insufficient for the chosen trigger.
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% Bumped this cut up to 80 GeV to synchronize with trigger efficiency measurement for AN v8/paper v2 </span>
   * L253: add a sentence describing/explaining lepton "isolation". Start with resolved case and then talk about modification for boosted.
   * L258: extraneous "and"
   * L261: "any event containing" (extraneous "s")
   * L262: "dileptonic tt decays" is jargon
   * L264: "muon (electron) events" --> "events with a muon (electron)"
   * Fig.3-5: captions inaccurate. Sum hadronic/dilepton ttbar into "ttbar other" for these and control plots, using that label defined in the text around L340.
   * L291: reader wonders about type-1/type-2 normalization; add something about top pT reweighting?
   * L304-320: Too many details on kinematic fit; just give a reference and leave in efficiency/purity info in L326-328 and the rest can go.
   * L341: DY Z/g+jets: add a * on gamma
   * L343: "top" is ambiguous, change to "non-semileptonic and single top" or similar
   * L344: "well-estimated contributions" is ambiguous
   * L347: "less precisely estimate from MC" is ambiguous
   * L352: Include M_t,lep^reco in control plots somewhere
   * L356: Just say the "problem" is low MC stats

%TWISTY{mode="div" showlink="Show " hidelink="Hide "  firststart="hide" showimgright="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"  hideimgright="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"}%
   * Discuss motivation for modified Lorentzian used in kinematic fit in greater detail in AN
   * Discuss separation of MC events by production mechanism using MC truth info in greater detail in AN
   * Perform a cross-check of data-driven QCD background estimation using QCD MC
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% This is done, please see [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/15.html][this thread on the HN]] for more details and plots. </span>
   * Run with/without "Rqqbar" nuisance parameter and quantify deviation from generator value and impact on PoIs
   * Mising parton shower (ISR/FSR/hdamp), underlying event (tune), and color reconnection systematics
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I've added these and will be estimating their uncertainty contributions using an a-posteriori method. Additional details are available in [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/12.html][this HN thread]]. </span>
   * Results for NNLO top pT spectra could be used to derive a theory-based top pT reweighting scheme
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I've done this (and it looks great!). Additional details in [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/13.html][this HN thread]]. </span>
   * Nuisance for pileup systematics seems to constrain a bit tightly: why might that be?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% According to Andrea Marini from Higgs Combine this is to be expected because the pileup uncertainty is conservative. It is common to observe.

   * Comments from Nick on Paper draft v0
      * Eqn 12: I assume that you do not run into any issues with -ve yields here? Are the yields in the regions A, B and C sufficient to avoid that?
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% Correct, we don’t have issues with negative yields because the yields in the A, B, and C regions are indeed sufficient. I tuned the MET cuts in each channel partially to solve this problem! </span>
      * In Section 6 you could probably mention the constraints on these nuisance parameters - eg are they assumed to be log-normal / Gaussian etc ...? It could be added to Table 1 
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I mention the nuisance constraints briefly in Section 7 (lines 435-438), but I can definitely add them to the Table as well. </span>
      * Fig 9 is very nice - I don't often see this in so much detail however, I am confused perhaps about 1 thing. Are you using here directly the measured value of the parameter as the "test-statistic" ? Often the neyman construction involves using the likelihood outcomes to order the results (actually this is more the Feldman-cousins way). Maybe I am misreading those plots.
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I gave a presentation in a StatComm meeting about this ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762830/contributions/3170892/attachments/1730085/2795956/statcomm_10_8_2018_neyman_and_gof.pdf][link]]) that has more details than I can include here. </span>
   * From statistics questionnaire: after unblinding I will need to return with something about Goodness of Fit.

   * Many of my nuisance parameter uncertainties constrain post-fit. In particular:
      * JES/JER
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I tried splitting these into several contributions to no avail. I also double-checked my templates and fitting methods, and tried smoothing templates to decrease the effect, again with no observed changes. This ended up being the focus of a BIG discussion in HComb, but in the end we decided to estimate these systematic impacts conservatively, using an a-posteriori method rather than relying on template morphing. My initial presentation on all of this to HComb can be found [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762838/contributions/3179852/attachments/1735769/2807459/hcomb_10_17_2018_nuisance_constraints.pdf][here]], and my presentation discussing the results of splitting the contributions among multiple sources, as well as our final a-posteriori treatment, is [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762840/contributions/3208961/attachments/1752395/2839895/hcomb_11_14_2018_a_posteriori_JEC_systematics.pdf][here]. I'll be using a similar a-posteriori treatment to estimate impacts from parton showering, underlying event, and color reconnection uncertainties since these are also accounted for using independent event samples, which results in overconstraining of the associated nuisance parameters in template morphing. </span>
      * Ren/Fact scale
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% These uncertainties are large prefit; constraints are often observed by analysts. </span>
      * Pileup
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% This uncertainty is also conservative prefit; constraint can be expected. </span>
      * Lumi
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% This constraint was due to correlations with other parameters and is now much less apparent as will be shown in AN v9. </span>
      * R* scale/transfer factors
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% We expect these to constrain as I put in by hand a large prefit uncertainty. </span>
      * b tagging efficiencies
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I split these contributions by jet flavor (b, c, light) and observed a lessening of the constraints as will be shown in AN v9. </span>
      * boosted electron trigger efficiency
         * <span style="color: blue;"> This was measured conservatively, but the constraint still seems a bit tight even considering that. It's not too concerning, however, due to the very small impact it makes on the PoIs. </span>
      * top pT reweighting uncertainty
         * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% We expect this to constrain as its true value should certainly be determined by fits to data. In AN v9 I will show results from theory-driven top pT reweighting, and that the constraint on that nuisance is less severe than what we observed for the older version of top pT reweighting. </span>

   * In the boosted regime you write that you use HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT OR HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165. The egamma recommendations for these paths [1] is to use them OR'ed with some HLT_Photon. Otherwise these paths become inefficient for electrons with pt > 300 GeV. Have you checked somehow that these electrons do not play a significant role in the analysis? 
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I didn't end up OR-ing with a photon trigger in that channel for three reasons. The first is that it wasn't available as one of the triggers I had in my nTuples already, and the second is that there are very few selected events, even without trigger requirements in the boosted regime, with electron pT>300 GeV (a few dozen events). The last is that I spoke with Anastasia Karavdina who performed the trigger efficiency measurement I'm using, and she investigated OR-ing with a photon trigger and found minimal impact on either the selected events or the efficiency measurements (likely because the uncertainties are rather large to begin with). </span>

   * Are impact parameter cuts applied?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% They were not originally, but have been added for AN v7. </span>
   * Are you using high-pT-specific ID?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I decided against using it to sychronize with the boosted electron trigger efficiency selection. </span>
   * Please add estimated QCD contribution to control plots

Is "pass conversion veto" applied?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% Yes, variables are extracted as detailed. Pass conversion veto IS applied and this is now listed in AN v7. </span>
   * Effective area corrections: which values were used?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% Old values. Since updated to current values listed [[https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/data/Summer16/effAreaElectrons_cone03_pfNeuHadronsAndPhotons_80X.txt][here]] in AN v7. </span>
   * HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf has been prescaled after the 2016D period. Is this taken into account?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% From Sergio (trigger contact): "In some significant fraction of the lumi after Run2016D the lowest unprescaled seed for HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf_v had a higher threshold than the HLT threshold, but the path itself was not prescaled. Therefore you will loose some efficiency at low pT. However what you are doing is not wrong, as long as you are using Andrey's scale factors ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/604912/contributions/2490011/attachments/1418869/2173471/2017.02.27_EGM_Ele25-and-Ele27-trigger-SF_v1.pdf][link]])."

   * L325-327: add reference
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I am also not sure what to cite for my trigger choices? Mohsen says it's not a big deal, it just might come up with the ARC. </span>
   * L336-364: for all regions, apply medium ID but tight isolation?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I apply medium ID in all regions, yes, but two different sets of isolation criteria for boosted/resolved events. Boosted (type-1/type-2) events require only the "2D cut" for isolation, but resolved (type-3) events require both the 2D cut and tight PF isolation. This is also why the isolation efficiency scalefactor is only applied to type-3 events. I clarified this language for AN v7. </span>
   * Ref. 28: provide paper ID please
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% recommended citation (that I've now also included in AN v7) is [[http://inspirehep.net/record/1260669][this PAS]]. </span>
   * Fig. 7: data/MC ratio increases from type-1 to type-3: why?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% This was due to two things, the first being that those plots did not show any data-driven QCD contributions, which I've added in ANv7. The second was that my type-3 selection was a bit too loose (I've since changed it in AN v7 to require two medium - rather than loose - b-tagged jets). Sent along new plots to confirm. </span>
   * L703-720: isolation SF applied only to type-3 events? loose ID SF applied to all events?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% Indeed the isolation scalefactor is only applied to type 3 events because type 1 and type 2 events don't have any PF isolation requirements. For all events the medium ID SF is applied. The reference to "loose" here is a holdover/typo from a previous note version, and my language has been fixed and clarified for AN v7. In that version I also binned my plots of isolation better, and added overflow bins to all of my control plots. </span>

   * L316: In addition to asking that there is at least one ‘good’ vertex (which is what this filter does), do you require that it's the first one?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% I added this requirement for AN v7 </span>
   * JME POG does not perform a dedicated calibration of AK8 jets. I guess that, given that you perform a kinematic fit while allowing jet momenta to vary in magnitude, you are probably not very sensitive to a potential miscalibration of these jets. Still, have you investigated this in any way or checked with other analyses that had? Alternatively, if JEC uncertainties in the boosted topologies have a small impact on your measurement compared to other systematic uncertainties, you should be safe. If you have impact plots that show the ranking of systematic uncertainties, I'd be curious to see them. Otherwise, I think the scale of AK8 jets needs to be validated or you should check with JERC conveners if the uncertainties for AK8 jets are considered okay.
      * <span style="color: blue;"> %OK% JERC conveners validated that AK8 jet uncertainties are alright. [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/jes/754.html][x]] </span>

   * Muon selection: muons |eta| should be < 2.4 as there are no muon detectors beyond 2.4
      * <span style="color: blue;">%OK% Done, this change will be reflected in the next iteration. </span>
   * For the electrons your trigger intrinsically has isolation requirement. It is generally best to apply offline criteria that are tighter than the online ones, so I have some concerns about this case. Isn't there an alternative electron trigger with higher pt cut but no iso requirement? It would be good to contact the electron and trigger TOP PAG contacts.
      * <span style="color: blue;">%OK% Changed the electron trigger in the boosted channels to HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165 OR HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT after B2G Z' to boosted ttbar analysis. Anastasia Karavdina has scalefactors for this trigger configuration's efficiency measurement that I can use. </span>
   * you also need to get your privately derived electron scale factors approved.
      * <span style="color: blue;">%OK% This wasn't the case before, but scalefactors have now been measured for all of the triggers I'm using, so my preliminary private measurement is no longer needed. </span>
   * What corrections are applied in the control plots shown in Sec. 5.8 and 6.4? Generally good agreement for type-3 mu+jets events, but there are significant discrepancies in the other categories.
      * <span style="color: blue;"> Control plots shown include all corrections listed under "systematics". Bugfixes and changes brought agreement much closer. Note that control plots don't include estimates of QCD background, and that top pT reweighting has a significant effect on the normalization of top MC, especially in boosted channels. </span>
   * Please note that the binning of the scale factors you use should match you selection cuts, i.e. if you require lepton pt > 55 GeV, the corresponding SFs bin should be e.g. [55-60], not e.g. [50-60]. 
      * <span style="color: blue;">%OK% I double-checked the scalefactor measurements I'm using, and adjusted the boosted lepton pT cut to 50 GeV (from 55 GeV) since the bin edges are reliably at 50 GeV. The resolved channels' lepton pT cut at 30 GeV also reflects bin edges with no problem. I have a simple measurement of the b-tagging efficiency in MC for AK4 jets and I edited the histogram limits in that file to reflect the AK4 jet selection criteria. </span>

   * what's causing the normalization issue in type-1 events?
      * <span style="color: blue;"> As mentioned above this is now greatly improved in v6; control plots do not show estimates of QCD background, and top pT reweighting as well as various bugfixes have a large effect on MC normalization. </span>
   * what's the timeline to add missing systematics (additional modeling uncertainties, etc.)?
      * <span style="color: blue;">%OK% If there are any specific systematics I'm missing that are very impactful I can implement them ASAP, but I believe I've accounted for the most dominating effects up to this point. </span>
