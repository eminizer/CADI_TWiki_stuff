---+!! Review of TOP-15-018: Measurement of the ttbar AFB at 13Tev in boosted/resolved l+jets

%TOC{title="Contents:"}%

---++ Introduction

This analysis is a template measurement of the top quark forward backward asymmetry and anomalous chromoelectric/chromomagnetic moments in boosted and resolved l+jets events using the full 2016 dataset from CMS and the LHC. Our CADI line is TOP-15-018 ([[cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines?line=TOP-15-018&tp=an&id=1550&ancode=TOP-15-018][link]]), and we have a review hypernews ([[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018.html][link]]).

on version 19

   * %PURPLE% Does the word "linearized" need to be in the abstract ? 
      * Yes, it's an important distinction with respect to the number we've measured.

   * %PURPLE% "Parameters of interest......" - These details do not need to be written in the abstract.
      * This sentence describes one of the unique aspects of our analysis: that it is model-dependent, and separates out the contributions from qqbar and gg. I'd prefer to leave it for now, but would have no problem removing it if requested at the FR.

   * %GREEN% L22 - Define c*-odd and c*-even states here to avoid any confusion.

   * %PURPLE% L33 - Shouldn't the recent D0 result be referenced (Measurement of top quark polarization in tt lepton+jets final states Published 01/09/17:  Phys. Rev. D 95, 011101(R) (2017), arXiv:1607.07627) 
      * I don't understand how this measurement of the top quark polarization is relevant here.

   * %PURPLE% L41 - "...an LO..." -> "...a LO..." 
      * CMS guidelines suggest not reading out the full phrases corresponding to acronyms, and instead choosing article agreement based on the sound of the pronounced acronym, in this case "ell-oh" which begins with a vowel sound.

   * %PURPLE% A reference should be given for equation (2).
      * This didn't come from any references.

   * %PURPLE% L129, 130 - identification of the top quark has not been described anywhere.
      * The description of the applied top tagging is in lines 272-278 in paper draft v19.

   * %PURPLE% L185 - Are these offset corrections described in reference 34 ?
      * I am not sure, this comes from the CMS boilerplate text, and it doesn't suggest a reference.

   * %PURPLE% L193 - L199 - The b-tagged jets have been already removed from the jet collection, right ?
      * No, this paragraph describes the lepton-jet cleaning applied to all jets that have a lepton clustered into them, possibly including b jets.

   * %PURPLE% L219 - Usually the efficiency is lower for electrons than muons. But, in the boosted channel it is higher ?
      * This is due to the particular measurement of the boosted electron trigger efficiency, which was produced in a highly fiducial region.

   * %GREEN% L229, L231 - Are these two MADGRAPH generators different ?
      * No, they are the same, I've removed the duplicate reference.

on version 20

   * %PURPLE% L255 - How is pT(rel) calculated ? Is it the difference between the lepton and the jet pT ?
      * It is the component of the lepton momentum transverse to the three-vector of the jet (or vice versa).

   * %GREEN% L259 - "...through the sum" -> "...to the sum"

   * %GREEN% L272 - Be consistent in writing either "Type" or "type" everywhere.
      * I've gone through and made sure that we now always say "type" unless the word is at the beginning of a sentence or at the start of a plot's legend or a table entry, in which case we say "Type".

   * %PURPLE% L272 - Are you saying that in Type-1 events the top quark is a AK8 jet ? In L277 it is mentioned that the pT of the AK8 jet is > 400 GeV. At such high pT values the top quark jet (all decay products merged together) is usually reconstructed as a fatjet with cone radius 1.5, or 1.2, and AK8 jet is considered to be the W coming from the top. So, isn't the AK8 jet going to be too narrow to contain all the decay products of the top ? Have you checked this ?
      * Yes, we assume the hadronically decaying top quark in type-1 events appears as a single AK8 jet. It's true that analysts are now more often using even larger jets for this, but AK8 jets have been used very commonly to represent merged hadronic top quark decays. The 400 GeV requirement on the pt is directly from the top-tagging criteria.

   * %PURPLE% L286 - Type-1 and Type-2 events have highly boosted top quarks. So, what is the efficiency of getting AK4 jets separately ? Is the fatjet divided into subjets and then b-tagging is checked for the subjets, specially for the Type-1 jets ?
      * I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean by "what is the efficiency of getting AK4 jets separately." The AK8 jets do have their subjets identified, and we use those in the reconstruction, but the working point of the top-tagging algorithm we've used does no require any subjet b-tagging.

   * %GREEN% L289 - What about the c-quark misidentification rate ?
      * That's included in the quoted mistag rate; I changed the sentence to reflect that.

   * %PURPLE% L315 - Do these numbers correspond to 35.9 fb-1 luminosity ?
      * Yes they do, so do the expected MC contributions we quote later.

   * %PURPLE% L318 - These variables should be defined, instead of saying "Drell-Yan variables".
      * They are the reconstructed versions of the same variables defined in Section 2; the sentence explains this.

   * %PURPLE% L324 - Instead of showing the discrepancy and then explaining, is it not better to show the corrected distributions ?
      * These plots are all pre-fit. The post-fit data/MC template comparisons in Figs. 9 and 10 show them corrected; though it may not be easy to see because of the template binning.  

   * %PURPLE% Why are the shapes of the c*r distributions so different in Fig. 6 as compared to those in Fig. 4, 5 ?
      * The highly boosted hadronic top quark decays in type-1 events tend to be reconstructed more centrally; this is due to several acceptance effects.

   * %PURPLE% L438 - "..the particular jet is fully, partially, or notmerged,..." -> "..the particular jet is fully, or partially reconstructed, or notmerged,..."
      * The terms "fully-merged," "partially-merged," and "not merged" describe three different categories of efficiency corrections. They don't have anything to do with the reconstruction but instead are determined by a MC matching procedure.

   * %GREEN% Figure 10 caption - "FComparisons" -> "Comparisons"

   * %GREEN% (7) L66-67, ..., L308 (now L311 in v19) and L313. These lines may be shortened from (a) ...  (i) ... (j) L308 (now L311 in v19, as well as three other places): "type-1 and type-2 events are further required to have ..." --> "type-1 and -2 events are further required to have ..." In addition, to be consistent with many other places in this paper, the similar changes may be made at other three places, they are L280, L286-287, and L415-416.

   * %GREEN% L309, where it needs to be changed from "for which a MC-based ..." --> "for which an MC-based ..."

   * %GREEN% L318, to follow the good examples on L322, etc., it can be shortened from "Figures 4, 5, and 6 show comparisons of ..." --> "Figures 4-6 show comparisons of ..."

   * %GREEN% L635-636, in [1], to be consistent in this Section, the month info should be removed

   * %GREEN% L777-782, Refs.[52] and [53] are identical, one of them should be removed.

   * %GREEN% L798, in [58], to be consistent in this Section, all references should have only one page index instead of two; Another one which also needs to be changed by the similar way is [79].

   * %GREEN% L802, in [60], to be consistent in this Section, a space should be added before the volume index

   * %GREEN% L851, in [78], to be consistent in this Section, the Erratum should be changed from "[Erratum: Eur. Phys. J.C73,2501(2013)]." --> "[Erratum: Eur. Phys. J.  C  73 (2013) 2501]."

   * %GREEN% L853-854, in [79], to be consistent in this Section, (a) the journal name should be shortened; (b) an extra index after the year number should be removed, i.e. (together with the item (8) above for the page index) "Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research 221 (1984), no. 2, 437 -442," --> "Nucl. Instrum. Meth. 221 (1984) 437," Another one which also needs to be changed by the similar way as (b) is [80].

   * %GREEN% "A Appendix 1: reweighting factors" --> "A Appendix 1: Reweighting factors"

   * %GREEN% L818, in [66], to be consistent in this Section and this paper, the font of "ttbar" and "pp" in the article title should be changed from "ttbar(italic) Production in Lepton+Jets Events in pp(italic)" --> "ttbar(non-italic) Production in Lepton+Jets Events in pp(non-italic)"

   * %GREEN% L255: since the "Delta eta**2" (the "Delta phi**2" is the same) may be looked ambiguous as either "Delta((eta)**2)" or "(Delta(eta))**2", two pairs of bracket should be added, similar as all other CMS papers (including our Higgs boson discovery paper HIG-12-028, at the bottom of Page 4) have done regardless how it is written in the CMS style guideline)

   * %GREEN% Abstract: Suggest "...CMS detector in a data sample corresponding to..."

   * %GREEN% Abstract: Suggest "...using a fit of the kinematic distributions of the decay products to..."  -- this is to avoid adding the missing apostrohe

   * %GREEN% line 33: strike "the" after "dominates"

   * %GREEN% line 84: Suggest adding these words at the end of the sentence: "...frame, and c* was defined in Section 1."

   * %GREEN% line 107: Why do you capitalize Beyond the Standard Model here but not in the Abstract nor at line 42?
      * This is a mistake; it's no longer capitalized here.

   * %GREEN% line 191: "remove" --> "identify"

   * %GREEN% line 251: "is not optimal" -- better to state the reasoning here unambiguously.
      * I just removed "because the reconstruction of an electron object in this region is not optimal" in this sentence; I don't think that explanation is necessary.

   * %GREEN% line 264-5: This is a sentence fragment. It looks like two sentences that were inadvertently combined.
      * Good catch, thank you. I split this into two sentences, which now read: "Requirements are also imposed on the \ptmiss\ in each event to suppress background from multijet events containing a muon or electron. Events in the boosted topologies are required to have $\ptmiss > 50$ or $>100$ \GeV, respectively, and resolved events of both lepton flavors are required to have $\ptmiss > 40\GeV$."

   * %GREEN% line 270: Suggest changing to "...to have pT>30 and pT>200 GeV, respectively, and..."

   * %GREEN% line 289: 9% misidentification prob for light flavor jets -- gluon jets too?
      * Good catch; changed this to "...misidentifying a gluon or light quark jet as...."

   * %GREEN% line 297: strike "AK4" after "possible" since it is redundant with the AK4 later
      * These few sentences are better organized overall now thanks to another reviewer's comments (including fixing the redundancy you point out).

   * %GREEN% line 323: "..normalization that is larger than optimal for describing data..." --> just say that the method tends to overestimate the observed multijet data
      * These sentences now read: "As seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:control_plots_t1}--\ref{fig:control_plots_t3}, the data-based method used to determine the multijet background contributions tends to overestimate the observed data; also, the disagreements visible in the \xr\ distributions are due to the choice of the PDFs.  Both of these systematic effects are corrected by the fit to data." I think that's more clear overall?

   * %GREEN% line 521: "inputted" --> "input"

   * %GREEN% A_FB: Nowhere in the paper did I find a state of the art value for A_FB from the SM. I want to use that to compare to the nice result of this paper. You say in various places that the value is ~5%, or that the agreement between your measured value and with the NLO and NNLO QCD values is good. But why not provide one reference number so the reader can compare for themselves?
      * We cite after the "approximately 5%" comment references 4-7, which make slightly different predictions depending on how the calculations are done, but I agree with this comment. I changed the sentence on lines 29-30 to read: "The NLO effects generate positive values for \AFB\ in \qqbar-initiated subprocesses~\cite{4-7}; the most recent SM prediction for the total asymmetry is $\AFB=0.095\pm0.007$~\cite{7}." which allows direct comparisons to be made.

   * %GREEN% ttbar production: At line 13 you do a great job describing the main contributing processes to ttbar production at the LHC. However at line 339 you make the point of including also qq, qbarqbar and qiqj mediated processes, which are tiny. Why not mention these tiny ones here too?
      * The numbers I quote here lump everything that's not explicitly "qqbar" or "gluon-gluon" into the "qg" category, because that's the greatest level of detail about the event provenance that I have determined in the MC samples I've used, so it's not possible for me to separate out those subprocesses any further than "neither qqbar nor gluon-gluon". I agree with your comment, though, so I think maybe the best way to handle it is the change I've made: to omit "and 25% qg" from the sentence at line 13. This way the reader can tell at line 13 that 75% of the ttbar production comes from qqbar+gluon-gluon, and down at line 339 it will then become clear where the rest of the ttbar events come from in the NLO calculations. If you have any different suggestions for how to present this information with the constraint about MC provenance in mind, though, I'd love to hear them, and I apologize that this is my best idea for the time being.

   * %GREEN% Determination of theta*: Determination of incident quark direction in qqbar events comes form the direction of p_L as you say. I am curious still about the dilution factor. In Fig 3 you plot it in a vertical range [0.0,inf). But can D be less than zero? Meaning can you have more incorrect pairings than correct pairings? Also you say that at large |x_f| the dilution factor D becomes large. But the curve in Fig 3 turns over for |x_f| > 0.7. What impact does the |x_f|>0.7 regime -- and the potentially large incidence of incorrect definition of c* definition -- have on the analysis?
      * To your first question, D can absolutely be less than zero, we just don't observe that. To your second, there are extremely few events with |x_F|>0.6, and the pictured reversal of the trend is a consequence of MC statistics and not physics. The 8 TeV version of this plot had better statistics in that region, and did not exhibit that behavior. Multiple people have pointed this out, though, so I regenerated the plot of the dilution factor with a single bin for 0.6 < |x_F| < 1.0, and that data point is only slightly lower than those in the previous bins, showing that the general trend holds. I think this is still honest regardless, though, since the reader can see from the plot in the top right of figure 3 that very few events end up having |x_F|>0.6, so that region doesn't make much contribution to anything.

   * %PURPLE% Yields: Data yields for 3 types split by e/mu are inline at line 129. Predicted signal and background yields are listed inline at lines 377, 379, etc. Why not put all these numbers in a very satisfying table?
      * Yes, I would have liked this as well, and I'm still open to it. The reason it's not here now (and why I'm not going to put it in before the FR on monday morning) is that those event yield numbers were added after CWR, and my ARC decided to not make any changes as impactful as adding new tables or figures that late in the game. Again I would be more than happy to add such a table, but I do not personally feel qualified to produce a version of it that would be acceptable to everyone and so I'd like to talk about changes this substantive at the final reading so the decisions are more open.

   * %GREEN% Fit functions f(y): I did not go through an independent derivation to verify the accuracy of these expressions, nor for the other supporting expressions in the paper (for instance, in Appendix A). I trust that the authors and ARC checked these for accuracy. Confirm?
      * From our end, yes, absolutely, they've been checked over.

   * %PURPLE% Transfer factors: At line 399-401, if these values of the transfer factors are crucial for the body of the paper, why not put them in a table? They are not easy to digest inline in the text like this.
      * Once again I'm more than happy to do that, but I don't feel comfortable adding a new table and formatting it without significant input from others this late in the game.

   * %PURPLE% Systematic Uncertainties: Besides knowing what uncertainties were considered, the reader wants to know what is the dominant effect and by how much, or if there are several uncertainties of similar importance. Table 1 is excellent for the first aspect of this but actually misleading on the second aspect. Particularly the "Size" column, which I hoped meant "Here is the relative improvement when this single source of uncertainty is neglected, indicating its relative importance." But that is not what this column means. Inline in the paper at line 510 you say that PDF/alpha_s is the dominant source, which is good to mention. But by how much? Is it close to the others? Which others? Are they experimental or theoretical? What if a PhD student 3 years from now when statistics are less of an issue wanted to pick up this analysis and work on reducing a source of systematic uncertainty. What should they work on? AFAICT that information is not here. I think it is worthwhile to include some more detail on this. Can be done in 2 more sentences.
      * First, you are correct that the "size" column indeed does not represent the post-fit impacts of each systematic, but rather the general scales of their pre-fit uncertainties. I explain this in the caption of the table, as you've pointed out, so I don't know if I would consider it "misleading," and I think the information it does add is useful, but I understand and agree with the point you're making. However, the systematic impacts were a source of a LOT of my work last year, and there's a ton of information to be had about them across the three independent measurements. They are also impacted in some cases by a smoothing procedure, and so direct comparisons beyond pointing out the dominating effects (tuning the amount of QCD contribution, the shape effect from the PDFs) are nontrivial. I therefore do not personally feel comfortable trying to digest that information into a couple sentences with less than 48 hours to go before the FR, but I am certainly open to discussion about it at that time. I'm sorry.

   * %PURPLE% Quality of fit: At line 543 you give the p-values for the three fits, all around 0.25 or so. This is a nice detail to include. But then you say these values indicate the models describe the data "acceptably well". This is a subjective statement. What is acceptable? Instead maybe just be quantitative, interpreting the p-values as indicating consistency btwn the data and the extracted model params at a given level. Consider framing it in an example interpretation in terms of %ages. The reader can then judge if this is acceptable or not.
      * I'm sorry to keep doing this, but I again don't want to make such a substantive change to the text at this point, especially because this particular sentence already represents edits from other reviewers. I don't disagree with your suggestion, but maybe we can again talk about this at the final reading, so that I can make a change that everyone is happy with.

   * %GREEN% Figure 1a) The third Feynman diagram might look slightly better is the arrow was moved away from the crossing points of the top quark lines. At first, I thought it was a dot, which didn’t make any sense to me.
      * Agreed, Morris edited the Feynman diagram in question for me and the new version won't have this problem, it now has the two arrows further up on each branch rather than overlapping in the center.

   * %GREEN% Line 171-173: It seems like there is either some redundancy here or there is a subtle difference that I am not getting. The end of the sentence that finishes at the beginning of line 172 seems to say the same thing as the next sentence (172-173).
      * I deleted the end of the sentence at L171 and just left the two about MET that follow it. (I was asked to use this particular language for defining MET so I think it's best to resolve the ambiguity this way.)

   * %GREEN% Line 217-219: Is this sentence trying to give the trigger efficiency for events that pass offline cuts? If so, perhaps it could be worded slightly differently. What about, “The average trigger efficiencies for events passing offline selection are approximately….”
      * Yes, that's what I'm trying to say. I love your suggestion, and have copied it in wholesale. Thank you!

   * %PURPLE% Line 532: Should this be natural log (i.e. “ln” )?
      * It could be (as in, yes, it is a natural log), but this is language I took directly from another CMS paper that used one-sided profile likelihoods at the guidance of the statistics committee, so I'm hesitant to change it. I also use "log" again in an axis label in Figure 8. I don't mind it being either way, but for the time being I think I'd prefer to keep it and maybe talk about it at the FR. It's not a major change to make.

   * %PURPLE% Lines 3-41: I am trying to understand how this represents a different approach. The sentence says that you separate the qqbar process from the others. In the fit, I believe you use the theory expectation for the fraction of qqbar initiated events and then use a binning that given a region with enriched qqbar (?). Is that what you mean by this statement?
      * This sentence is explaining that our measurement is not model-independent, in that we adopt a model that separates out the gg and qqbar contributions to the cross section. I am not sure what you mean by "I believe you use the theory expectation for the fraction of qqbar initiated events and then use a binning that given a region with enriched qqbar (?)." but we fit a cross section model to the entire observed phase space, where the differences in the distributions of the template observables for qqbar and gg events (Fig. 3) gives the fit its sensitivity to the amount of qqbar-initiated events. That fraction is allowed to float within a small uncertainty, as well, as described in L485-487. I am more than happy to talk about this more, sorry for my initial confusion.

   * %GREEN% Figure 3, lower right plot: Above about 0.7, there are likely very few events. Nonetheless, the error bars are many sigma away from the plateau. Is this expected?
      * This is not expected, but it also has no real physics content because, as you say, it's just a consequence of very few MC events at high |x_F|. The 8 TeV version of this plot had better statistics out at larger |x_F| and did not show this; instead the points at very high |x_F| just stayed up near 1.0. That said, enough people have asked about this that I've changed the binning in the histogram so that there's just one bin from 0.6 < |x_F| < 1.0, which I don't think is disingenuous since it's apparent from the plot in the top right of figure 3 that there are extremely few events there anyway, and in this case the plot itself looks better and the trend doesn't appear to reverse.

   * %GREEN% Line 253-262: I found the description of the isolation requirements confusing. It seems like you are defining a “2D selection” and a Pt sum of PF candidates in a cone. I think from the description, the “2D selection” is applied to the boosted events and BOTH the “2D selection” and Pt sum are required for the resolved events. If I have this correct, you may want to consider simply defining the “2D selection” in the sentence starting on line 253 and not attributing it to the boosted case as it is written now.
      * Absolutely! Thank you for this suggestion. I have changed this portion from "Lepton isolation in boosted events is determined with a ``2D selection'' applied as..." to "Lepton isolation is determined in part with a ``2D selection'' applied as...." which I think does away with the confusing attribution to the boosted events.

   * %PURPLE% Lines 270-283: Have you considered putting all the requirements in a table? It might be a better way to present this long list of selection cuts.
      * That would be a good idea (I have cutflow tables in our analysis note), but I'm not confident enough in the design of such a table to add it right before the final reading, and I've been asked not to make substantial edits like adding extra tables or figures.

   * %PURPLE% Figures 4-6: The caption states that these “show their nominal predictions”. Does the Data/MC agreement get any better after the nuisance parameters have moved around to find the best fit? For example, the type 3 e+jets (Figure 6) appears to have both a normalization difference (top plot) and a shape (middle plot).
      * Yes it does, though the small number of plots I have in the paper doesn't make this explicitly obvious. For that reason, I mention the dominating effects in lines 322-325, which read: "As seen in Figs. 4-6, estimating multijet background from data tends to produce a nominal normalization that is larger than optimal for describing the observed data, and the slope in the xr distribution is sensitive to the choice of the PDF set as can be seen in the figures. Both of these systematic effects are corrected by the full fit to data."

   * %PURPLE% Line 387: Should this be a delta log-likelihood? It just gives “-2 ln L”. If not, I am confused. It might be worth providing the reader with some sense of the fraction of events passing/failing such a cut.
      * This is not a delta log-likelihood, it's a requirement on the best-fit value of the kinematic fit function, like a chi^2, as defined on line 312. This was meant to be explained by the sentence in lines 387-390, which refers to it as the kinematic fit function value. I actually removed from this sentence at the suggestion of another reviewer a definition explaining this right before I use the -2lnL variable, so I'm wary of adding that back in. I also don't want to add an efficiency of this selection because the efficiencies are different in each channel, I don't give efficiencies for any of the other selections, and this selection is just used to define a control region anyway...maybe at the FR I can talk to some more experienced people about making a change.

   * %GREEN% Figures 9 and 10: I found the colors on these plots a bit difficult, especially the vertical bars that are supposed to be separating the bins. Figure 10 was slightly better because I believe there is a bigger difference in the line thickness. If it is possible to consider a color change as well, it might make these more readable
      * Yes, someone else pointed this out as well, thank you! I've changed those lines to now have different styles as well as colors and thicknesses, and I think they look quite a bit more unique now. The rest of the colors in this plot I've changed several times and I'm not sure what would make an improvement, but if you or anyone else has any specific suggestions it would be very easy for me to change and replace these plots.

   * %GREEN% L62: the integrated luminosity is quoted also at L212. Do it only once (my preference would be to leave it at L212)
      * Agreed, I'm leaving it at 212.

   * %GREEN% L87-90: I suppose that the fact that you are allowed to merge gg and qg distributions is because they are similar, not because their asymmetry is 2 oreders of magnitude lower than for qq
      * It's kind of important that there is a (small) expected (and modelled) asymmetry from the qg process, but indeed the reason for combining them is that their distributions in the template observables are very similar. I chaged this sentence to read: "Because of this similarity, and because the SM asymmetry for \qg\ events is expected to be approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than for \qqbar\ events \cite{Kuhn:1998kw}, the \glu\ and \qg\ subprocesses are combined into a single distribution function in our analysis." which I think addresses both of those things appropriately?

   * %GREEN% L172-173: this is a repetition of what written at L171

   * %GREEN% L199: AK is not (strictly) a cone algorithm, so it's not appropriate to refer here to the "jet radius"
      * Changed this to "...reconstructed jets within {\DR} less than the distance parameter of the jet clutering algorithm."

   * %GREEN% L204: "bosonic" ==> "W boson", because I suppose you are referring to jets from W decays and not from Z decays

   * %GREEN% L206: the jet mass resolution is improved both for the W system and the top, so it's better to remove "around reconstructed bosons"

   * %GREEN% L220: POWHEG is used for other channels, so I suggest to move ref. [42] right after "generator"

   * %GREEN% L274: "These tagged top quark (t-tagged) jets" ==> "These identified top quark (t-tagged) jets", to avoid the repetition, and the use of jargon (the first time, the second is our local definition)

   * %GREEN% L285: "tagged" ==> "identified"

   * %GREEN% L287: "tagged as a b quark (b-tagged)" ==> "identified as a b quark (b-tagged)", see above

   * %GREEN% L297: the sentence "and the possible AK4 ..." seems to be hang without the ending explanation. maybe a verb is missing?
      * Indeed, this sentence is meant to explain how type-1 events are reconstructed from their constituent physics objects. Changed this sentence to read: "In type-1 events, the top quark that decays to all-jets is assumed to be the \PQt-tagged AK8 jet, and the lepton side of the decay is reconstructed from all combinations of the lepton, \ptmiss\, and any \PQb-tagged AK4 jets that result in a lepton+jets top quark candidate (lepton + \ptmiss\ + AK4 jet) separated from the \PQt-tagged AK8 jet by $\DR(\PQt_{\text{jets}},\PQt_{\text{lep}}) > 2$."

   * %GREEN% L320: "summed according to lepton Q", but "Q" is defined later at L333.
      * I just removed this reference to summing over the lepton charges, since the current version of the text doesn't talk about charge separation at all until the beginning of the next section (as you pointed out).

   * %GREEN% Caption of fig. 4, 5, 6, last sentence: "observed data/MC in" ==> "observed data to MC expectation in"

   * %GREEN% L337, eq. 7 and other places: to avoid misinterpretation as a power exponent, I would suggest to replace "f^n_{bk}" with "f_{bk,n}", and "R^n_{bk}" with "R_{bk,n}"

   * %GREEN% Caption of table 1: "R^t/C/R_QCD" ==> "The quantity R^t/C/R_QCD", so as not to start a sentence with a symbol; the last line could read "in each topology, channel, and region" with no need to introduce the symbols "t", "C" and "R"
      * Changed this sentence to "The quantities $R_{\text{QCD}}^{t/C/R}$ indicate that the QCD multijet yield uncertainties are independent in each topology, channel, and region."

   * %GREEN% Table 1: - "n_PV" is undefined, and can be defined near L168; the symbols "A" and "E" are undefined
      * I removed the "E" in the table since the factors actually don't depend on energy. For "A" and "n_PV" I think it might be most clear to define them the first time they're used in this section, both of which are in the paragraph about jet energy corrections, in line 414.

   * %GREEN% Fig. 7: there is room for increasing the font size of the legend entries

   * %GREEN% Caption of fig. 7: "nuisance parameters floating" is jargon, suggest to replace it with "nuisance parameters let free to vary"

   * %GREEN% Caption of fig. 8: guidelines recommend not to use color to refer to different histos/curves, so in this case you might use different line styles

   * %GREEN% Figs. 9, 10: I believe the acronym "SR" used in the titles has not been defined
      * Added this definition on line 538

   * %GREEN% Caption of figs. 9, 10: "Fitted data/MC comparisons" ==> Fitted data vs MC expectation comparisons"; again don't use color to distinguish lines

Abstract:

Introduction:
   * %GREEN% L8, insert “CERN” before “LHC”.
   * %GREEN% L10, insert a hyphen before “order”.
   * %GREEN% L15, Remove this hyphen. The "top quark" is  defined as a permanent compound word at CMS. [If you don't like this, you can use: "top quark, top antiquark, and gluon".]
   * %GREEN% L20, replace “For those” with “When”; and delete “that”.    
   * %PURPLE% L21, insert “from” after “or”.
      * I think the sentence construction here is such that the parenthetical clause doesn't repeat "from the relative directions of" but rather only replaces "the initial-state quark and the top quark". In other words, the "from" you're suggesting to add I think is implied already.
   * %GREEN% L29, delete “small”; replace “for” with “of”; and replace “, on” with “that are of”. [Yes, I know that both have been used at CMS, but “on” is wrong and “of” is right!]
   * %GREEN% L33, delete “the”.

   * %GREEN% L51, delete “are”; delete “values”; and change “with” to “using”. 
      * I think "with" is correct here (I could also use "at" but I don't think "using" is correct), since we get the positive or negative cstar information from the simulation. Otherwise I agree with this comment, though, and have made the changes.
   * %GREEN% L56, replace the comma with “of the kind:”.

   * %GREEN% L74, replace “describes” with “reviews”.
 
   * %PURPLE% Table 1: The statement “shape of the distribution” is redundant. Drop  “shape of”; and CMS does not start sentences with acronyms. 
      * I was asked to include "shape" to describe where the "S" in the label comes from, but I did fix the sentence in the caption that started with R_QCD^t/C/R.

Summary:

   * %GREEN% L3: the top quark couple to the Higgs field, not to the Higgs potential! Please, rephrase accordingly.
   * %GREEN% LL17-18: delete "final state" - top quark is not a final-state particle!
   * %GREEN% LL20,21: replace "final state" with "the" [see previous comment].
   * %GREEN% L58: define fabc as the SU(3) group structure constants.
   * %GREEN% LL61-62: delete "in 2016 ... 35.9 fb−1", as you repeat this on LL206-209.
   * %GREEN% LL91,105: note -> we note [do not tell a reader what to do!].
   * %GREEN% Figure 2, lower left plot: the upper end of the x axis has value labels overlapping with one the other - please decrease the number of labels; lower right plot: replace "Dilution factor" with D in the y axis label.
   * %GREEN% L107: strong coupling constant.
   * %GREEN% L108: drop "rest".
      * I was asked to add "rest" at some earlier point, but i forget when and I agree with this comment so I dropped it again
   * %GREEN% L117: give a reference here ([20] ?).
      * indeed this is the correct reference; I added it.
   * %GREEN% L138: The CMS detector and physics objects.
   * %GREEN% LL152-154: the sentence doesn't belong here; please move it to L213, and mention that this is the trigger efficiency corresponding to the offline selection.
   * %GREEN% LL157-163: swap the order of description of the electron and muon reconstruction here [the entire paper talks about muons before electrons; please follow the same order here].
   * %GREEN% LL169-171: please finish the definition of the "physics objects" here by adding the missing transverse momentum, per standard PubComm-recommended text.
      * The text I had used was out of date; I've changed it, and added the recommended bit about MET filters, as well.
   * %GREEN% L174: ... are clustered from the PF objects in an event using the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.4 (0.8).
   * %GREEN% L186: give a reference to the noise filters here.
   * %GREEN% L214: delete "v2 [23-25]" - already given earlier.
   * %GREEN% L223: we didn't use standalone MC@NLO in Run 2. Are you sure this was not generated with \MGvATNLO? Also, say that the sample was simulated at NLO.
      * This comment is correct, the sample used was generated with aMC@NLO. I added "simulated at NLO" to the text and also fixed the referece.
   * %GREEN% L226: are you sure you used MLM and not FxFx prescription? - The MLM is used for LO and not NLO!
      * This was my mistake. These samples are generated at LO, with MadGraph5 and indeed the MLM prescription. I fixed the language and the reference here.
   * %GREEN% LL238-244: please delete this tex, as it's a direct repetition of what you already said on LL120-129.
   * %GREEN% Figures 3-5: Single top -> Single t [or Single top quark] in all the legends.
   * %GREEN% LL365-366: ... single top quark, Drell--Yan Z/$gamma$+jets and W+jets,m and QCD multijet processes. [DY applies to both Z and W plus jets!]
   * %PURPLE% L377: all the selections in the paper are given by strict inequality; is there any reason to have ≥ her instead? For irrational numbers, this doesn't really matter, as you are never really on the boundary, most likely even after the computer rounding of floating numbers.
      * This is written the way it is because these two criteria are explicit negations of the strict inequalities defining cuts for the full selection region. I agree it doesn't matter much; if anyone wants it changed I'm happy to change it but on principle I'm leaving it as is for now.
   * %GREEN% L383: ... estimated from data using the matrix (``ABCD") method, which ...
   * %GREEN% LL381-385: you need to state here that the assumption for the method to work is that the two binning variables (lepton isolation and \ptmiss in your case) are uncorrelated. Have you checked that this is indeed the case and quantified he degree of residual correlation? - This would be important to mention in the paper.
      * I have not performed this exact check as the cuts I used were used identically in other analyses. That said, it's not very relevant since the final normalization is determined through the fit to data and the MET sidebands only influence the normalization of the shape. I added a reference to a paper that did something similar, and changed around my entire discussion of the QCD background estimate to be much more clear. Also, I did perform a MC cross check of the method in general as documented in Appendix B of our AN that should show the efficacy of the exact method used.
   * %GREEN% L412: give a reference to our total inelastic cross section measurement to support the 4.6\% number.
   * %GREEN% LL447-448: ... generated with the renormalization (μ|rmR) and factorization (μF) scales varied up and down by a factor of two, both independently and simultaneously, resulting ...
   * %GREEN% Table 1: define RW+jets in the caption, as you do with the RQCD.
      * I added definitions of these parameters to the text above the table instead, but I think that gets the job done.
   * %GREEN% Figure 6: toy median values -> pseudo-experiment median values in all legends.
   * %GREEN% Figure 7: "Other t quark and Z/γ+jets" in all legends. [Note that DY includes W+jets!] 
   * %PURPLE% What are the two significant outliers in the third-row plot between bins 180 and 190? How many standard deviations are they away from the predictions?
      * These only look large because of the large bin content. The residuals in the plot below show that the corresponding deviations are reasonably within uncertainties.
   * %GREEN% Table 2: observed p values appear to be too good. For instance for the d and μ fits, all of them are above 50% and most are very close to 1. I think you need to comment on this in the paper, as it clearly looks like your error bars are too big.
      * This was indeed an issue; it was related to my accounting of signal vs. background processes in combine for the d and mu fits in particular. I've switched to using the "saturated" test statistic for goodness of fit, and the p-values calculated over all signal regions are 0.206, 0.233, and 0.274 for the fits for Afb, d, and mu, respectively. The next version of the paper draft will include this information, and the AN will be updated with the plots showing how the test-statistic values for fits to data are well-distributed within those observed for pseudo-experiments.
   * %GREEN% L802: here you should really give a reference documenting the calculation of the weights.

   * %GREEN%  Abstract: The fit results on the three parameters (pars) of interest are presented, this is very nice, but it is not clear if this is a simultaneous fit of the three pars or fitting only one par at the time and setting others to zero. Same for the summary of the paper. I think the important point of fitting only par at a time should be made clear in those places.
   * %GREEN% Drell Yan variables, you call them first (l.90) c*, xF and mTT and then suddenly in l.312 c*_r, x_r and m_r, are the latter really introduced. I searched for it by eye and couldn't find it.
      * added a clause explaining that this is to distinguish the reconstructed values from those at parton-level.
   * %GREEN% p.14 you discuss the 4D binned observable vector and that you optimise the binning for the different Channels. In Fig. 7 then one can see the bins, but one has to do guess work how e.g. the 222 bins in the Type 3 mu + jets are related to the 4D space (m_r, x_r, c*_R) and Q. Couldn't you give somewhere (e.g. appendix) some more information on the order of variables in the 222 bins and roughly how many bins for each of the variables are used?
      * I changed the postfit comparison plots to show the bin boundaries, so that should make this a lot more clear, and I also added a paragraph explaining how we break up the space, as well as an Appendix of tables directly listing the binning schemes.
   * %GREEN% l.455 the smoothing of the templates seems quite important. For the nominal templates you use Barlow Beeston light but for the alternative templates zero stat. Uncertainty right? 
      * that's correct, no stat. uncertainty on the shifted templates.
It could be mentioned:
   * %GREEN% what smoothing algorithm was used, e.g. KDE or Splines often there is some steering parameter related to the effective length of the smoothing
      * Added to the text: "Some shifted templates are smoothed before fitting by merging bins in \mr\ and \csubr\ and applying the average shifts."
   * %PURPLE% that stat. unc. of the templates after smoothing are neglected in the final fits.
      * I think adding a comment to this effect would create more confusion than it would clear up because the shape systematics generally speaking ignore statistical errors on the shifted templates.
Further question:
   * %GREEN% is it a 4D smoothing or smoothing of the mapped 1D histogram? If if is the latter: how to deal with inevitable jumps in the 4D distribution mapped to 1D, corresponding to increasing one observable value and and jumping from last to first value of another observable?
      * The smoothing is very simple, and only applied to some of the systematic-shifted templates (those that are accounted for using separate MC samples rather than variations in event-by-event reweighting factors). The "smoothing" just replaces the fractional change in each bin with an average fractional change, where the average is over all bins of cstar with the same sign and all bins in ttbar mass. I found in my studies that this doesn't largely effect anything about our results other than the post-fit constraints on these systematics' nuisance parameters. Added to the text: "Some shifted templates are smoothed before fitting by merging bins in \mr\ and \csubr\ and applying the average shifts."

   * %GREEN% l.486 talking here about interpolating shapes within the +-1 sigma interval but what about outside that region, how do you extrapolate?
      * the interpolation in combine is quadratic for shifts between +/- 1 sigma, and linear beyond that. I added an explanation of this.
   * %GREEN% l.493-498 You don"t say anything about the assumed true values of nuisance pars in the throwing of the toy experiments,  e.g. set to zero or do use the profiled values as function of the pars of interested. The latter is the prescription in the ATLAS+CMS combined note from 2011.
      * The systematic nuisances are either not varied at all, or allowed to float within their uncertainties in generating the toys, depending on whether the group of toys is used to estimate statistical uncertainty only, or the full statistical+systematic uncertainty. The explanation in the AN is more clear about how the Neyman construction is done. I added a sentence explaining this at the end of the paragraph: "The statistical uncertainties are estimated using groups of datasets where the systematic nuisance parameters are fixed, and the full statistical+systematic uncertainties are estimated using groups of datasets where the systematic nuisance parameters are allowed to vary within their uncertainties."

l508-519 GOF-tests. From the CMS Statistics Committee we have some overview of suitable tests at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/StatComGOF On this page there is a link to Bob Cousins's article http://cousins.web.cern.ch/cousins/ongoodness6march2016.pdf In his article he points out difficulties with GOF tests in higher dimensions. 
   * %GREEN% The test you are doing is in the 4D observable space y, right? So the test would depend on the binning ordering scheme of the four variables, right? 
      * Yes. I was not aware of this until now.
   * %GREEN% Why are the p values for d and mu so close to unity, any idea? Wouldn't one expect them to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1?
      * This was indeed an issue; it was related to my accounting of signal vs. background processes in combine for the d and mu fits in particular. I've switched to using the "saturated" test statistic for goodness of fit, and the p-values calculated over all signal regions are 0.206, 0.233, and 0.274 for the fits for Afb, d, and mu, respectively. The next version of the paper draft will include this information, and the AN will be updated with the plots showing how the test-statistic values for fits to data are well-distributed within those observed for pseudo-experiments.
   * %GREEN% Maybe a chi2 GOF test would have been also possible based on the -2ln L using the saturated model, as implemented in the combine tool and described on the above twiki.
      * Indeed, this is exactly what I did! Thank you!

   * %GREEN% There is not much said about the outcome of the template fits on the nuisance pars, are there any large pulls observed or not?
      * this was the subject of a LOT of my work and several presentations in Top Properties and also Higgs Combine. The long story short is that the few pulls that are large have real, explicable causes. The AN has the pull plots in it, and explanation of some of them in an Appendix as well. I added to the text the sentence "The dominating systematic effect is observed to be the PDF/\alpS\ variation, which corrects the \xF\ distribution to better agree with that observed in data" which I think is a succinct description of what we observed, generally.
   * %GREEN% Figure 7 what does the MC uncertainty in the plot mean, is this something related to Post-fit uncertainties?
      * It's the full statistical+post-fit systematic uncertainty from combine. I added a line to the caption explaining this.

   * %GREEN% It contains sentences that at times ignore the "Oxford" comma rule of CMS.
   * %GREEN% Sentences that begin with acronyms.
   * %GREEN% Sentences that are far too long and too convoluted to provide clear meaning. In particular, most of Section 7 is abysmal. The descriptions of systematic uncertainties in L400-478 and in the table correspond to some of the worst I have seen at CMS. It is unfortunate that your LE could not help improve this important section.
      * I've handled a ton of this stuff thanks to the attached PDF. Just for the record, though, I want to say that this is an unimaginably rude thing to say about someone's earnest work. I would never speak this way to any colleague of mine, regardless of the quality of the product of their efforts.
   * %GREEN% Authors use many poorly chosen words (one example is using the word "clean" instead of "cleanse") and prepositions.
   * %GREEN% Improper hyphenation (e.g., using "t-tagged" rather than "t tagged").
   * %GREEN% Overuse of "considered", when that word is redundant.
   * %GREEN% General misuse of the terms "leptonic" and "hadronic," where "lepton" and "hadron" (or jets) are meant.
   * %GREEN% The confusing use of a parallel sentence structure with some items appearing in parentheses.
   * %GREEN% Confusion of hadrons with jets and with quarks (the top quark decays to "Wb" or to   "q \qbar b" and not hadronically, as these quarks evolve into jets).
   * %GREEN% Confusing the background from multijet events with the expected background from MC QCD-generated multijet events. It is best to use “QCD multijets” only when meaning the MC events.
   * %GREEN% You use too many unneeded quotation marks that I have also tried to correct. 
   * %GREEN% The labels in figures must be consistent even in font with those used for the same objects in the text.
   * %GREEN% Please note that "varying" is not the same as "changing". You rarely vary parameters, except in fitting. Unless you use a floating change, most of your variations should be called "changes by one standard deviation."

   * %GREEN% I don't understand the sentence in L100--103. Please clarify your remarks concerning the C--S frame. And does direction mean c*?  How is that shown in Fig. 2?
      * I reworded several of the sentences near here; I think the whole idea is clearer now.
   * %GREEN% L136-137: I assume that this means that you have one dependent value and two that you float in the fit? Please clarify what you mean.
      * That's right; I added explanation of this to the end of the second-to-last paragraph in the systematics section
   * %GREEN% L168-169: This sounds like nonsense! Eliminate it!
      * Updated to most recent version of the recommended CMS text from the publication guidelines TWiki.
   * %GREEN% L301: What do you mean by this endpiece? I would drop it.
      * I explain this better now
   * %GREEN% L309: This looks incorrect, as L is < 1?
      * If you check the form to the likelihood in the analysis note you can see why it would be able to go negative.
   * %GREEN% Figs. 3-5, legends: "single lep"->"lepton+jets", "ttbar other"->"ttbar other channels", lowercase "+jets" instead of "+Jets", "QCD multijet"->"multijet events"
   * %GREEN% Figs. 3-5: Please make the corrections shown, and correct the font labels to make them agree with the text. Also increase the size of the subscripted "r", and change the c*r  to cr*
      * Will come back to this
   * %PURPLE% L322: Again, your phrasing is difficult to follow. Shouldn't you be saying extensions beyond the SM?
      * There's not much difference between what we have here and the suggestion.
   * %GREEN% L463-467: There too many words here to decipher! Please clarify and simplify all these terms, including "B".  
   * %PURPLE% Section 7: The above descriptions are among  the worst I have seen at  CMS. It is truly unfortunate that your LE could not help you improve these.
      * Thanks for all the constructive comments you made to this paper. As this special comment is not constructive at all, we took the liberty to simply ignore it.
   * %GREEN% L474: what is this scaling?
      * changed this to "affecting the normalization of"
   * %GREEN% Table 1: Note that "shape" is not a scientific term. What you mean is "distribution," which is fine. And perhaps can also change the "S" to "D"
      * I've seen "shape" used in many CMS papers, so we prefer to leave it in, but I explain this better in  the caption of the table now (including the word "distribution".)
   * %GREEN% Table 1: Please change all the "type" to "Type"; remove the hyphens after the "b" and "t";
   * %GREEN% Table 1: You should define all \sigma terms, or simplify the table. Do you mean the dependence of the uncertainty? That is, "Uncertainty in"? 
      * I changed this to "uncertainty in" and I'm not sure what else I can do to make the column more clear. I intended for it to summarize the dependencies that were discussed in the section above the table.
   * %PURPLE% L493-498: These three lines are annoying! Please remove the theatrics and simplify the language. 
      * We implemented your proposed changes and think that the text is now more clear.
   * %GREEN% L508-519: This paragraph is another dilly! The long sentences with their subtleties are hard to decipher
      * This will be improved when I change how I'm reporting the goodness of fit information
   * %GREEN% Fig. 6: change all "fit" to "fitted" and "true" to "input"; in legends, "toy median values"->"Median MC values" and "data fit"->"fitted data".
   * %GREEN% Fig. 7: Please increase the size of the print and data points, and fix the other issues. The colors are too dark and hide the data points. Expand the ratio plots by plotting just the central-most values. In legends, "QCD"->"Multijet", "+Jets"->"+jets". x-axis title: "template bin"->"Template bin"
      * I also split this into two figures so that all of the plots were easier to read.
   * %GREEN% Refs. 7-17: I don't understand the ordering of these references. And certainly Regina must recall that this measurement was first performed by Regina's Rochester postdoc at D0. and should be quoted before the far later claims by CDF. I also don't understand the logic of the ordering of ATLAS and CMS. Please take a better look at this.
      * Reordered them to put ATLAS before CMS, and also have them in chronological order.

Title:
   * %GREEN% L1, delete “Template” and change “measurement” to “Measurement”;
   * %GREEN% L3, replace “the semileptonic channel” with “lepton+jets t\tbar events”.
      * Changed this to simply "in proton-proton collisions" at the suggestion of another reviewer.
Abstract:
   * %GREEN% L1, replace linearized with “linearized”; and insert “the” after “”and”.
      * Added "the." ARC suggests not to add quotes around "linearized." 
   * %GREEN% L2, replace “are” with “have been”, and “in” with “using”.
   * %GREEN% L3, replace “collision data” with “collisions”; replace “with” by “in”; and delete “in 2016”. [I should remark, as I have done in the past, there is no interest in the date you obtained the data, except for issues of priority or specification of proper corrections. I therefore do not see any reason for advertising such information in this manuscript, and especially in the abstract.] 
   * %GREEN% L4, insert “of” before “13”; and insert an “a” after “to”.
   * %GREEN% L5, replace “plus” with “and”; insert “in” before “final”; remove the quotation marks on “boosted” and replace “boosted” with “highly Lorentz-boosted”. [No quotation marks in line.]
   * %GREEN% L6, insert “jet” before “topologies”; and change “of” to “to”.
   * %GREEN% L7, replace “to” by “of the”; replace “measured using” with “extracted from”; and insert a hyphen after “binned”. 
   * %GREEN% L8, delete “of differential models”; replace “based on” with “using”; and since “tree-level” is theoretical jargon, I would put that in quotation marks.
   * %GREEN% L9, replace “are determined” with “found”.
   * %PURPLE% L11, replace “measured” with “obtained”.
      * This sentence is gone now
   * %PURPLE% L12, replace “directly comparable” with “compared”; replace “derived from” with “measured at the”. 
      * The sentence is gone now.
   * %PURPLE% L13, delete “measurements”.
      * The sentence is gone now.

   * %GREEN% Figure 1 caption, replace “(a) Feynman diagrams for the leading-order (LO) quark-antiquark (qq) and gluon-gluon (gg) initiated subprocesses. (b) Example diagrams for the next-to-leading-order (NLO) quark-gluon (qg) initiated subprocess.” with “(a) Feynman diagrams for LO q\qbar- and gg-initiated t\tbar subprocesses; and (b) example diagrams for the NLO qg-initiated subprocess”
   * %GREEN% L14, replace “In this paper, we” with “We”.
   * %PURPLE% L15, replace “of” with “in”; replace “top-quark-antiquark-gluon” with “top quark-top antiquark-gluon”; and replace the second “by” with “through”.
      * I agree with the "through." ARC says that "top quark-top antiquark-gluon" looks rather strange and could easily be misinterpreted, and that "of" and "in" are both correct; we prefer "of".
   * %GREEN% L16, replace “These” with “Such”.
   * %GREEN% L17, replace “by” with through; replace “effects” with “impacts”; insert a comma before “where”; and insert a hyphen after “final.
   * %GREEN% L18, replace “with respect to” with “relative to the direction of”; and delete “direction”.

   * %GREEN% L31, replace “antiproton” with “the p\pbar”; and replace “operating at center-of-mass energy” with “that operated at a CM energy of”.
   * %GREEN% L32, replace “significantly larger than” with “somewhat larger, especially at CDF, than expected at the NLO level.” [Concerning Refs. [7,8], please check my comment in the reference section, as D0, unlike CDF, never made a big deal of this issue.]
   * %GREEN% L33, delete “NLO QCD expectation”.
   * %GREEN% L35, delete the first “the, and “Collaborations”. [I don’t understand why ATLAS references are given after those from CMS.] 
      * I switched the order of CMS/ATLAS -> ATLAS/CMS also

   * %GREEN% L52, replace “effects” with “impact”.
   * %GREEN% L54, insert comma before “end”; and replace “the” with “an”.
   * %GREEN% Eq. (3), You have too many uses of "\mu". Perhaps just use it for the muon and the chromomagnetic moment. And also define \gamma, b, c, and gs.
      * I've added the extra definitions, and also a hat and a subscript \PQt to the PoIs.

   * %GREEN% line 49-51: did we make this check ourselves? If so we could say so
      * Morris did, yeah! Added an explanation of it : )
   * %GREEN% line 105: I get confused on the discussion you have on figure 2.  First: is Dilution the right name for this variable in fig 2d?  D=1 means  no dilution, right? Then there is the discussion on the increasing value  with xF. For xF <0.7 the values are close to one and I assume this is  what you mean with the 'increasing values in the qqbar dominated area. But then there is a drop of D for larger xF values. What is the reason for that? It looks beyond just statistics.
      * Other papers on asymmetries have called this variable dilution, so I think we'll keep it. The drop is indeed statistical; it wasn't observed in larger MC samples, but regardless there are hardly any events selected in any channel with |xF|>0.7. 
   * %GREEN% line 170 The ruin-2 vertex selection also include the pTMiss at the vertex as an object. This should be added 
   * %GREEN% line 180 add a reference to the method used for the mentioned off-set correction
   * %GREEN% line 190-191 Why do we term this 'key based cleaning'?
      * Because it looks for the PF candidate "key" of the muon in the list of jet PF candidate "keys." Regardless, this sentence is edited and "cleaning" is no longer used.
   * %PURPLE% line 213: So the electron is not required to be isolated here?
      * no, the electrons in the resolved regions are required to be isolated; I explain this in lines 257-262 in paper draft v11. The discussion of trigger efficiencies here has been moved to the systematics section, so it might be more clear that this sentence is only about the trigger requirements and not the isolation.
   * %GREEN% line 217: "as they are halved or doubled: you mean for the systematic uncertainties later? otherwise it is not clear to me what the sentence means...
      * Agreed, I describe the systematic variations more clearly later, so I removed "as they are halved or doubled" here.
   * %GREEN% line 226: do we really use the MLM here? This is normally used on for LO programs while for NLO we use FxFx merging
      * This was my mistake. These samples are generated at LO, with MadGraph5 and indeed the MLM prescription. I changed the MadGraph reference.
   * %GREEN% line 278 For the type-2 we require 4 AK4 jets (as for type-3, see line 281), I assume one from the leptonicaly  decaying top and one from the hadronically decaying one. So it means that all jets from the top decays must be resolved? If not, why do we have the condition of 4 AK4 jets for type-2?
      * Type-2 events contain at least one large AK8 jet, with no top-tags, but the reconstruction only uses the resolved jets in the events, identical to that for type-3 events. I found that this bridged the gap between merged and resolved events more effectively than requiring a W-tagged jet, or anything else like that. I added some text to make this more clear.
   * %GREEN% line 299: After this line one should add what the advantage is of using Type-2 at all in this paper. It concerns 10% of the events and we do not use the AK8 feature. I take that this class less background/better efficiency for the kinematic fitting than the type-3? 
      * Yeah, they don't give us a ton of power, I just include them to bridge the gap between the other two scenarios. I improved my overall explanation of the topologies and their purposes in this paragraph.
   * %GREEN% line 379-380: "that are less resolved": do you mean broader? But the W+jet should not have a "top quark mass" at all..?
      * "less resolved" does mean broader. The "top quark mass" referred to is the mass of the reconstructed leptonic top quark, which for W+jets events indeed is not localized around the top mass because it's not a real top, it's some hadronic stuff that gets collected together and forced to look as much like a top as possible by the kinematic fitting function. Regardless, I changed this phrase to "that are further away from"
   * %GREEN% line 383: So is region D the nominal signal selection region. Do we use this methodology to predict the background in region D? 
      * Yes, on both counts, except with the single distinction that the same estimate is made in the W+jets control regions, so in that case the "D" region is the nominal W+jets control selection region. Regardless, this paragraph has been heavily edited and is now much more clear.
   * %PURPLE% line 414: "multiple independent methods" This very vague. Can we add a bit more information here on the type of cross check triggers that we used?
      * I took this language directly from another published CMS paper; it would add a lot of text to give the details of where these estimates come from, so I'd like to avoid that, but the measurements are those that are POG-provided in every case except for the boosted electron+jets measurement, which was taken from another CMS work with identical selection.
   * %GREEN% line 424 Uncertainties "are retained"... you mean calculated or determined? Otherwise we can just drop 'are retained and' here.
   * %PURPLE% line 448: Do you also use the combinations where one scale is scaled-up by a factor of two and the other is scaled down? It is recommended to exclude these combinations from the systematic error determination, as otherwise it gives a too pessimistic  estimate. 
      * No I don't, I've left them out as recommended.
   * %GREEN% line 458: very few details are given in this section, on what is exactly used for modelling choices for the colour reconnections, unlike in other papers.If we do the same as done in these papers maybe we should refer to it?
      * I use an envelope of the three "MPI-based," "QCD-inspired," and "gluon move" models; I added citations to them.
   * %GREEN% lines 475-478 : these lines sound a bit mysterious and I am not sure I understand what you mean to say here.
      * I mean only that a scalefactor nuisance is included that allows the normalization of the QCD multijet background to float within its statistical uncertainty from the sideband estimation method. I think I make this a little more clearer now with the RQCD parallel to the RWJets parameters.
   * %PURPLE% line 492: Does it make any difference even if you would have assumed AFB = 0? I guess not.
      * no, the value from MC is really small anyway. I meant only that we don't model any variations in AFB for the mu and d investigations, the AFB used there is native to the MC sample used.
   * %PURPLE% line 520-522: It is fine if A_FB agrees with these results and calculations but it is far and foremost also very much compatible with zero. So we actually don't really measure anything yet. I found the formulation in this paragraph misleading.
      * The comparison here is mostly ruling out the large values originally measured at the Tevatron, which is not "measuring nothing," and the SM does not predict AFB=0. We're discussing with the ARC about whether to make changes here. 
   * %GREEN% Figure 3: in some of the figures here the data is clearly lower than the prediction and well outside the MC uncertainty. Is this not a worry?
      * This is a known issue. The data-based QCD estimate tends to slightly overestimate the amount of background in the signal region in many cases, especially for type-3 electrons, but it's corrected before fitting. I added a quick comments about this in the text, also.

   * %GREEN% Line 19: Is it possible to add a figure to show what theta star angle is (like figure 6 in the AN)?
      * Yes!
   * %GREEN% Line 257: “..p_T^Rel > 30 GeV or ..” (GeV is missing)
      * I was told by someone else that p_T^Rel is dimensionaless, so I removed the unit, but that doesn't make any sense to me. I'm adding it back in as you suggest.
   * %GREEN% Figure 3-4-5: Please use the same scale for the Data/MC plots: plot on the first row, right side of figure 5 show that MC is overestimating the data.
      * I will adjust the scale on the plots in the next version. The overestimation is a known effect: our data-based QCD multijet background estimate tends to predict too large a nominal normalization of the QCD background; this gets tuned and corrected before fitting.
   * %GREEN% Line 492: a little bit confusing, we suggest to change into: “… in the fits for d (with mu=0) and mu (with d=0), which assume A_FB = 0.036…”
   * %GREEN% the paper doesn’t quote the number of the candidate ttbar events used in the analysis.

   * %GREEN% L.3 in "The top quark\u2019s Yukawa coupling to the Higgs potential ..." is ambiguous, stricly speaking the top quark does not couple to the Higgs potential but rather to the Higgs field no ?
   * %GREEN% Formula 9. there are indices 0,1,2,3,4 in formula 9, do they correspond to flavors in some sense i.e. 0,1,2,3,4 = g,u,d,s,c ?
      * no, it's a sum over the different background templates, of which there are three: W+Jets, QCD multijet, and everything else. This is explained in text near both of the formulas using this, and also I changed the summation variable to "n" so there's no ambiguity.
   * %GREEN% L.395-396 to which precision are these transfer factors known ?
      * They vary per channel. For type-1 mu+jets they are 30% and 20% for positively and negatively charged muons, respectively. For type-1 e+jets they are about 10%. For type-2 and type-3 events they are on the order of a few percent. I added this info in the systematics section where I talk about how we incorporate them.
   * %GREEN% L.412 is there a justification for this value of 4.6%  (maybe add a reference) ?
   * %GREEN% L.475-478 the stat. uncertainty on the transfer factors is mentioned but we don't have any idea of its size (difficult to relate with table 1)
      * added this info in the discussion of the RQCD factors.
   * %GREEN% Figure 6 for d it is difficult to see but the toy median values of the best fit for d versus the true d seems to be perfectly flat between -0.01 and 0.01 - is this large flat "step" a consequence of the sign ambiguity ? Why at these (apparent) particular values ?
      * We've actually changed our measurement of d to estimations of the 68% and 95% confidence limits on |d| using a likelihood profile. Because of the small expected value, and the sign ambiguity, these fits to toys were not reliable or regular.
   * %GREEN% Table 2 Why the d fit and mu fit p-values are so differents for type 2 e+jets between Q>0 and Q<0 ?
      * This was indeed an issue; it was related to my accounting of signal vs. background processes in combine for the d and mu fits in particular. I've switched to using the "saturated" test statistic for goodness of fit, and the p-values calculated over all signal regions are 0.206, 0.233, and 0.274 for the fits for Afb, d, and mu, respectively. The next version of the paper draft will include this information, and the AN will be updated with the plots showing how the test-statistic values for fits to data are well-distributed within those observed for pseudo-experiments.
   * %PURPLE% Fig 2 or elsewhere: maybe you could illustrate the effect of mu and d since the equations are quite complicated (while for AFB it looks relatively straightforward) ?
      * We do not think that adding a new figure showing these effects contributes enough to the reader's understanding to justify including it; it's not a very illustrative plot.
   * %GREEN% Fig 7: maybe adding dashed lines to separate regions of each (or some observables) would help understanding the binning and the sensitive variables
      * I added lines indicating the bins in xF and M! Cool idea!
   * %GREEN% l.137: why the extraction of each of the parameters is done separately instead of a combined extraction with e.g. a profile likelihood ratio ?
      * Each parameter depends on slightly different physics. We could have extracted mu and d simultaneously; for comparisons with other works it's good for us to have independent measurements.
   * %GREEN% the distributions are constructed by unrolling 4D distributions, which introduces discontinuities. Is the KS test really meaningful in this case ? There exist some versions for the multidimensional case but they look more complicated. Also, the p-values seem to cluster around 1 or < 0.2. Do you have an explanation ?
      * Same as my comment above, this is no longer an issue now that we've switched to the "saturated" test statistic.

General:
   * %GREEN% Throughout the paper (including in the Abstract, etc.), as the "AFB" has been introduced at the beginnings of the Abstract (on the 1st line) and the main text (on L23), it can be used afterward to shorten from (e.g. the 11th line of Abstract) "The forward-backward asymmetry measured ..." --> "The AFB measured ..." Other places where the similar changes can be made are L25, L48, L64-65, L78, L111, L113 and L520, etc.
      * I changed some of these. For others the distinction is important and so I've kept it.
Specific:
   * %GREEN% L7-8 the "(SM)" may should be moved forward from "In the standard model of particle physics (SM)," --> "In the standard model (SM) of particle physics,"
L18, L106 and L108: As the "CM" has only been used twice in whole paper and it is looked somehow similar as "CMS", it seems not very necessary to introduce it on 
   * %GREEN% L18, i.e. "in the ttbar center-of-mass (CM)" --> "in the ttbar center-of-mass" then, two places should be modified correspondingly, i.e. 
   * %GREEN% L106 and L108: (two places) "the CM frame," --> "the center-of-mass frame,"
L27, L228, L238 and L240. I'm not sure whether the article word "the" should be added at the beginning of these sentences, i.e. 
   * %GREEN% (a) L27: "NLO effects in QCD" --> "The NLO effects in QCD" 
   * %GREEN% (b) L228: "MC samples used are normalized to ..." --> "The MC samples used are normalized to ..." 
   * %PURPLE% (c) L238, L240 and L243: (three similar places) "“Type-1(or 2 or 3)” events are those ..." --> "The “Type-1(or 2 or 3)” events are those ..."
      * These no longer exist; I removed them because the definitions here are redundant.
   
   * %GREEN% L33, I'm not sure whether a comma is better to be replaced by a semi-colon, i.e. "NLO QCD expectation, however, more recent results [9–11] are ..." --> "NLO QCD expectation; however, more recent results [9–11] are ..."
L41, L48 and L112. As the "LO" has been introduced on L9-10, it can be used to shortened from 
   * %GREEN% (a) L41: (also, to follow the good example on L107, from the pronunciation point of view, the article word "a" should be changed) "The adopted model is a leading-order ..." --> "The adopted model is an LO ..." 
   * %GREEN% (b) L48 and L112: (two places) "leading-order" --> "LO"
L66-67, L136, L173, L207, L212-213, L247, L258, L273, L306, L308 and L313. These lines may be shortened from 
   * %GREEN% (a) L66-67: (as the "d" and "mu" have been introduced on L52-53) "Values of the anomalous chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments have ..." --> "Values of the d and mu have ..."
   * %GREEN% (b) L136: "to the cross section hypotheses in Eqs. (4), (5), and (6)." --> "to the cross section hypotheses in Eqs.(4)-(6)."
   * %PURPLE% (c) L173: (as the "PF" has been introduced on L155) "of all reconstructed particle-flow objects in an event." --> "of all reconstructed PF objects in an event."
      * The updated boilerplate text I'm using no longer has this problem : )
   * %GREEN% (d) L207: (to follow the good examples on L61, etc.) "in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV," --> "in 2016 at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV,"
   * %PURPLE% (e) L212-213: "single-muon trigger requiring an isolated muon with pT > 24 GeV, or a single-electron trigger requiring an electron with pT > 27 GeV." -->  "single-muon (-electron) trigger requiring an isolated muon (electron) with pT > 24 (27) GeV,"
      * There are no isolation requirements for the e+jets trigger paths, unlike those for muons.
   * %PURPLE% (f) L247: "and type-3 e+jets and mu+jets." --> "and type-3 e+ and mu+jets."
      * This reads far too awkwardly for my ear. I would consider "e/mu+jets" but I honestly want the distinction to be explicit here.
   * %PURPLE% (g) L258: (to follow the good example on L159, etc.) "according to the scalar sum of the pT" --> "according to the scalar pT sum"
      * I don't know, the sum is scalar as opposed to vector, and I refer to vector sums in the same paragraph. This text is boilerplate, also, so we prefer to keep it as is.
   * %GREEN% (h) L273: (as the "SD" has been introduced on L194) "jet mass after soft-drop application," --> "jet mass after SD application,"
   * %GREEN% (i) L306 and L313: (two places on each line) "type-1, type-2, and type-3 ..." --> "type-1, -2, and -3 ..."
   * %GREEN% (j) L308: "type-1 and type-2 events are further required to have ..." --> "type-1 and -2 events are further required to have ..."
L98-99 and L218-219, L143 and L160-161, L158 and L169. The "PDF", "eta" and "PV" should be explained at their 1st appearances in text on L98, L143 and L158, respectively, instead of L218 and L160 for the "PDF" and "eta", i.e.
   * %GREEN% (a) L98-99: (also, the "PDF" can be used to shorten L99) "and antiquark parton distribution functions of the proton are much “softer” than the quark parton distribution functions," --> "and antiquark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton are much “softer” than the quark PDFs,"
   * %GREEN% (b) L143: "calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by ..." --> "calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (eta) coverage provided by ..."
   * %GREEN% (c) L158: (as the "PV" has been used in Table 1) "at the primary interaction vertex as determined by ..." --> "at the primary vertex (PV) of interaction as determined by ..."
   (d) L218-219, L160-161 and L169: (then can be shortened correspondingly)
      * %GREEN% (i) L218-219: (also, as the "alphaS" has been introduced on L107, it does not need to be explained again at the end of L218) "on the choice of the parton distribution function (PDF) set NNPDF3.0 [45] with strong coupling alphaS = 0.118 ..." --> "on the choice of the PDF set NNPDF3.0 [45] with alphaS = 0.118 ..."
      * %GREEN% (ii) L160-161: "Muons are identified in the pseudorapidity range |eta| < 2.4," --> "Muons are identified in the range |eta| < 2.4,"
      * %GREEN% (iii) L169: "to be the primary pp interaction vertex." --> "to be the PV of pp interaction."

   * %GREEN% L119, it is looked odd that two words of "large..." are placed almost next each other. It may be improved by changing the 1st one from, e.g. "effects of the anomalous moments are largest at large pair mass." --> "effects of the anomalous moments are most significant at large pair mass." or "effects of the anomalous moments are most noticeable at large pair mass."
   * %GREEN% L122-123 and L127, it will be much more clear if the "type-1", "-2" and "-3" are introduced explicitly on these three lines, i.e. "the first of the three considered ttbar decay topologies comprises ... products are fully merged into single jets. The second topology...high pT. Finally, the third and most populated category includes ..." --> "the first (type-1) of the three considered ttbar decay topologies comprises ... products are fully merged into single jets. The second topology (type-2)...high pT. Finally, the third (type-3) and most populated category includes ..."
      * The new language I went with isn't exactly as suggested but I think it flows better. I agree that this is a good place for these initial definitions.
   * %GREEN% L189-190, I tried hard, but still have not understood the sentence of "each jet has subtracted (“cleaned”) from it the momenta of any leptons within it." well yet. Hopefully, this sentence can be revised to make readers earlier to understand.
      * I got some good suggestions on this; I think it's better now.
L221-223 and L229-231, to be consistent in this paper (e.g. L49, L95, L153-154, L396, Fig.7's caption, L737 and L743, etc.) and with all other CMS papers, (a) a hyphen should be added between "t channel" or between "s channel"; (b) the word of "channel" should be added after the "tW" and "W+jets and Z/gamma+jets", i.e.
      * %PURPLE% L221-223: (three places) "both in the t channel [46] with POWHEG v2 and MADSPIN [47] and in tW with POWHEG v1 [48]. Background ... quark processes in the s channel are simulated using the MC@NLO MC ..." --> "both in the t-channel [46] with POWHEG v2 and MADSPIN [47] and in tW channel with POWHEG v1 [48]. Background ... quark processes in the s-channel are simulated using the MC@NLO MC ..."
      * %PURPLE% L229-231: (four places) "in the s and t channels [53], at NLO plus next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL) for single top quark production in tW [54], at ... (NNLO) for W+jets and Z/gamma+jets [55]," --> "in the s- and t-channels [53], at NLO plus next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL) for single top quark production in tW channel [54], at ... (NNLO) for W+jets and Z/gamma+jets channels [55],"
         * These terms should not be hyphenated according to the [https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/Internal/PubGuidelines#Hyphens][CMS style guide].

   * %GREEN% L226, it seems more clear if some words are swapped and a word of "by" is added, i.e. "matched using the MLM prescription [51] to PYTHIA8 parton showers with tune CUETP8M1." --> "matched to PYTHIA8 parton showers with tune CUETP8M1 by using the MLM prescription [51]."
L228, L238, L240 and L243. I'm not sure whether the article word "The" should be added at the beginning of each sentence on these lines, i.e.
   * %GREEN% (a) L228: "MC samples used are normalized to ..." --> "The MC samples used are normalized to ..."
   * %PURPLE% (b) L238 and L240: (two places) "“Type-x” events are those ..." --> "The“type-x” events are those ..."
   * %PURPLE% (c) L243: (also, the appearances of two words "events" in the sentence may be avoided by modifying a few words) "“Type-3” events are relatively lower mass events in which the" --> "The “type-3” events have relatively lower masses in which the"
      * neither of the two above exist anymore; they were redundant.

   * %GREEN% L250-251, (a) the "calorimeter" may should be plural, (b) the reason for the rejection may should be briefly explained, i.e. "any electron candidates in the transition region between barrel and endcap calorimeter, corresponding to ..., are rejected." --> "any electron candidates in the transition region between barrel and endcap calorimeters, corresponding to ..., are rejected because the reconstruction of an electron object in this region is not optimal."
   * %GREEN% L255, (a) the "DeltaR" may should be defined at its 1st appearance in text here, then the "phi" also should be explained; (b) at the same time, since the "Delta eta**2" (the "Delta phi**2" is the same) may be looked ambiguous as either "Delta((eta)**2)" or "(Delta(eta))**2", in order to be less confusing, please do not forget to add two pairs of bracket in the formula of DeltaR; (c) as the numerical value of the angle phi has been implicitly shown on L257 and L259, etc., and an angle can be measured in either the radians or degrees, therefore, the unit of phi may should be specified, i.e. "and DeltaR with" "and DeltaR (= sqrt((delta phi)**2 + (delta eta)**2), where phi is azimuthal angle in radians) with"
      * I added the definition as exactly specified in the CMS style guide, but no definitions of eta/phi and no mention that radians are used is required.
   * %GREEN% L276, to be consistent in this paper (e.g. L273 and L194, etc.), a hyphen or a space may should be added between "softdrop", i.e. "softdrop mass in the range" --> "soft-drop mass in the range" or "soft drop mass in the range"
   * %PURPLE% L286-288, the expressions of "a b quark jet" and "a b tagging efficiency" are looked quite odd, similar as "a b c d xxxx". It may be improved by following the good examples on L215-216, L243, L272, L276 and L278, etc., i.e. (at three places) "a b quark jet and a 9% probability of misidentifying a light quark jet as a b quark jet (mistag rate). Type-3 events require ... ... working point of the algorithm with a b tagging efficiency of 63% ..." --> "a bottom quark jet and a 9% probability of misidentifying a light quark jet as a bottom quark jet (mistag rate). Type-3 events require ... ... working point of the algorithm with a b-tagging efficiency of 63% ..." or "a b-quark jet and a 9% probability of misidentifying a light quark jet as a b-quark jet (mistag rate). Type-3 events require ... ... working point of the algorithm with a b-tagging efficiency of 63% ..."
      * We prefer to keep it as it is.

Figs.3-5 and 7
   * %GREEN% (i) at the upper-left corner outside each plot, to be consistent in the text of this paper, two spaces before and after the symbol "+" should be removed, e.g. (in the left column of Fig.7, also to be consistent with Figs.3-5, a hyphen should be added after the "Type") "Type x mu  +  jets (SR)" -->"Type-x mu+jets (SR)" where the "x" is 1 or 2 or 3.
   * %PURPLE% (ii) The captions of Figs.4 and 5 are almost identical as Fig.3 except differing by one type-index on the 2nd line; thus, I'm not sure whether captions of Figs.4 and 5 can be entirely replaced by "Figure 4: The same Data/MC comparison as Fig.3, but for events passing full type-2 selection criteria." and "Figure 5: The same Data/MC comparison as Fig.3, but for events passing full type-3 selection criteria."
      * We prefer to not to refer to the captions of other figures and keep every figure as self-consistent as possible.
Figs.6-7, in the legends and axis labels, the 1st letter of each line should be capital, and the non-leading words should be in the lower case, i.e.
   * %GREEN% (i) Fig.6's caption: (the 1st and last lines) "toy median values ... ... data fit" --> "Toy median values ... ... Data fit"
   * %GREEN% (ii) Fig.6's vertical axis labels: "Best Fit ..." --> "Best fit ..."
   * %GREEN% (iii) Fig.7's horizontal axis labels: "template bin" --> "Template bin"

L319, L323, L372-373, L393, L396, L406-408, L432 and L496. These lines may be shortened from:
   * %GREEN% (a) L319: "transverse momentum of the measured and simulated events," --> "pT of the measured and simulated events,"
   * %GREEN% (b) L323: "in Eqs.(4), (5), and (6) for the numerators and" --> "in Eqs.(4)-(6) for the numerators and"
   * %GREEN% (c) L372-373: (also, it'll be looked and sound better if a comma is added after the 1st clause) "For the type-1 and type-2 regions the amount of W+jets background ..." --> "For the type-1 and -2 regions, the amount of W+jets background ..."
   * %GREEN% (d) L393: "events in the “B” sidebands to the “A” sidebands," --> "events in the “B” to the “A” sidebands,"
      * This whole paragraph has been heavily edited for clarity.
   * %GREEN% (e) L396: "in the type-1, type-2, and type-3 signal region ..." --> "in the type-1, -2, and -3 signal region ..."
   * %GREEN% (f) L406-408: (as the "JES" and "JER" have been used only one time on L408 in whole paper, they may not have to be introduced on L406-407, and then be spelled out on L408) "of a jet energy scale (JES) dependent on pileup as well as jet pT, ..., and a smearing of the jet energy resolution (JER) depen-dent on jet |eta|. The JES and JER factors are ..." --> "of a jet energy scale dependent on pileup as well as jet pT, ..., and a smearing of the jet energy resolution depen-dent on jet |eta|. The jet energy scale and resolution factors are ..."
   * %GREEN% (g) L432: (similar as the item (19a(i)) above, to be consistent in the text of this paper, two spaces before and after the symbol "+" should be removed; also, the 1st letter of this line should be capital in order to be consistent in this Section) "top quark pT reweighting: Recent NNLO QCD  +  electroweak calculations ..." --> "Top quark pT reweighting: Recent NNLO QCD+electroweak calculations ..."
   * %GREEN% (h) L496: (to be consistent with the tense in this Section, the verb "was" may should be changed) "in the toys whose postfit median was that" -->"in the toys whose postfit median is that"
L412, L418-419, L440 and L471-472.
   * %GREEN% Those uncertainty related quantities (e.g. 4.6%, 0.94, 0.96, 100 per-event weight, 1% and 10%, etc.) may should cite some reference articles, so that readers would not wonder why these numbers are chosen, why not any other arbitrary numbers.

   * %GREEN% L426, similar as the item (20g) above, the 1st letter of this line should be capital in order to be consistent in this Section, i.e. "top tagging efficiency:" --> "Top tagging efficiency:"
   * %GREEN% L430, from the pronunciation point of view, the article word "a" should be changed from "by a MC matching procedure," --> "by an MC matching procedure,"
   * %GREEN% L465, I'm not sure whether the "B" in the nominator should be explained, but an extra space in the denominator after the "b" should be removed or be replaced by a hyphen, i.e. "xb = pT(B)/pT(b   jet) for" --> "xb = pT(B)/pT(b jet) (where B is ...) for" "xb = pT(B)/pT(b-jet) (where B is ...) for"
      * added the hyphen and an explanation that "B" refers to the B meson.
Table 1
   * %GREEN% (a) In the header column, the 9th row above the bottom of Table, similar as the item (20) above, the 1st letter of this row should be capital to be consistent in this Table, i.e. "top pT reweighting" --> "Top pT reweighting"
   * %GREEN% (b) The location of Table 1 may should be moved backward to be below L495 since the "sigma" used in the 2nd column of this Table has not been explained until L495.

   * %PURPLE% L515, the "p-value" may should be given a Reference article, i.e. "in terms of a “p-value”:" --> "in terms of a “p-value”[xx]:"
      * I think this usage is pretty standard; I've not seen other papers cite references for it.
   * %GREEN% Fig.7, in the caption, the last two lines, to be consistent in this paper, a space before the symbol "+" should be removed, i.e. (at four places)"mu  +jets (left column) and e  +jets (right column) channels, and the ... type-3 mu  +jets (third row) and e  +jets (lower row) channels," --> "mu+jets (left column) and e+jets (right column) channels, and the ... type-3 mu+jets (third row) and e+jets (lower row) channels,"
   * %GREEN% Page 21, Table 2: In the header column, (a) the 1st letter of each row should be capital; (b) an extra space before the symbol "+" should be removed in order to be consistent in this paper; (c) a space should be added after the symbol ">" or "<" at the end of row in order to be consistent in this paper, e.g. (the 1st two rows) "type-1 mu  +jets (Q >0)" --> "Type-1 mu+jets (Q >  0)" 
   * %GREEN% L669, in [20], to be consistent in this paper and with all other CMS papers, a hyphen should be added in the article title, i.e. "Top production in hadron hadron collisions and" --> "Top production in hadron-hadron collisions and"
   * %GREEN% L678, in [23], the 2nd word in the article title may should be in the lower case, i.e. "A New method for combining NLO QCD with shower ..." --> "A new method for combining NLO QCD with shower ..." Another one which also needs to be changed by the similar way is [24] for two words of "Parton Shower".
   * %GREEN% The "year" numbers should be given for Ref.[42]. If there would be problems to display the year number with the default bib file, it may be fixed by changing from "article" to "unpublished" in the bib file.
   * %GREEN% L737 and L739, in [46], (a) to be consistent in the text of this paper and with all other CMS papers, the font of "s-" and "t-" in the article title should be changed; (b) to be consistent in this Section, the Erratum should be changed, "shower in POWHEG: s(non-italic)- and t(non-italic)-channel contributions”, ... arXiv:0907.4076. [Erratum: JHEP02,011(2010)]." --> "shower in POWHEG: s(italic)- and t(italic)-channel contributions”, ... arXiv:0907.4076. [Erratum: JHEP  02 (2010) 011]."
   * %GREEN% L799, to be consistent with all other Sections in this paper, the last word "Factors" in the Section title should be in the lower case, i.e. "A Appendix 1: Reweighting Factors" --> "A Appendix 1: Reweighting factors"

Even though structure and overall style of the paper are fine, there is an unusually large number of places where language improvements are needed, and/or where CMS style guidelines are not followed. To give some examples,
   * %GREEN% Is it sub-process or subprocess?
      * It's one word. Fixed all of these.
   * %GREEN% Wrong hyphenation in many places.
      * I've fixed a ton of these, some of them were supposed to be em-dashes, also.
   * %GREEN% Punctuation (commas) missing, wrong capitalization.
   * %GREEN% Spacing in some math expressions.
   * %GREEN% Jargon, such as pre-fit / post-fit and "ID".
      * and "toy"!!
   * %GREEN% Sometimes very convoluted sentences/descriptions, such as the paragraph on L.381-398.
      * Many people took issue with this paragraph; I completely rewrote the description to be more clear, and make better justification of the methods used.
We trust that the authors work with the LE and the publications committee
and improve all Type A issues.

%TWISTY{mode="div" showlink="Show " hidelink="Hide "  firststart="hide" showimgright="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"  hideimgright="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"}%

   * %PURPLE% The first paragraph of the paper, L.2-13, may benefit from a couple of references.
      * We can't find anything in this paragraph that needs a reference, though if there are specific suggestions we're more than happy to add them.
   * %GREEN% The definition of LO and NLO in Fig. 1 caption can be removed, it is already in the text.
   * %GREEN% The trigger efficiencies given in L.152-154 might better be moved to the end of paragraph around L.213, where trigger conditions are discussed. Also, a comment on the comparatively low efficiency in the resolved electron channel might be added.
      * moved, and added "The precision of the boosted {\Pe}+jets trigger efficiency measurement is limited by the number of events passing selection criteria."
   * %GREEN% L.202, "The subjects... are returned as individual objects": I guess what is meant is "retained" or "considered", rather than "returned"?
   * %GREEN% L.246, "mutually exclusive", along with L.269-281: From the text it is not clear how type-3 is made mutually exclusive with respect to the other two types of events. There must be some veto that is not mentioned in the text (or we missed it).
      * The exclusivity of type-3 events comes from a requirement that they not have any selected AK8 jets in them; I've updated the text at the end of this paragraph to make that clear. Thanks for the close reading!
   * %GREEN% L.265, "Events... require": please rephrase, the events do not require anything.
      * Fixed here and in other places as well
   * %GREEN% L. 301, "... or neither, with b-tagged jets in place." Very hard to understand what this is supposed to mean.
      * Changed the last two sentences in this paragraph to "Type-2 and -3 events ignore AK8 jets entirely in their reconstruction, and instead their jet assignment hypotheses comprise all possible assignments of the four or five highest \pt\ AK4 jets to either the leptonic or hadronic side of the decay; events containing five AK4 jets consider additional hypotheses in which any of the non-{\PQb}-tagged jets may be disregarded as external to the top quark pair decay." which I hope is more clear.
   * %GREEN% Figure captions 3-5: The captions mention the "pre-fit predictions", and in the flow of the paper they are right after the description of the "kinematic fitting" (L.305). Since one has nothing to do with the other, presumably, this should be rephrased and/or made clearer.
      * removed ", pre-fit" since the point is made by "nominal"
   * %GREEN% L.381-398: This paragraph includes a very convoluted description of the method and could benefit from simplification. Region D seems not to be defined. Also, the role of the W+jets control regions (L.397) is unclear.
      * I completely reworked this discussion.
   * %GREEN% L.402, "as described in Section 8": Seems to be towards the end of Section 7, rather than Section 8.
      * Yes, this was a change a while back. Changed this to "as described below" instead.
   * %GREEN% L.420, 424: How are uncertainties "retained"?
      * I removed this and tried to explain better. More than one reviewer pointed out this issue : )
   * %GREEN% L.445-446: What are "Modeling uncertainties in the matrix element generation process", and which "event shape distributions" is the text refering to?
      * The "modeling uncertainties" are the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties. The "event shape distributions" part is simply ambiguous. I changed this whole entry to read instead: "Modeling uncertainties on the renormalization (\muR) and factorization (\muF) scales used in the matrix element generation process are accounted for by reweighting simulated events to match alternate scenarios with \muR and \muF shifted up and down by a factor of two, both independently and simultaneously, resulting in three nuisance parameters describing \muR, \muF, and combined \muR-\muF\ scale variations \cite{Cacciari:2003fi,Catani:2003zt}."
   * %GREEN% L.458-467: The uncertainties on color reconnection and b fragmentation need references.
      * I hope those that I added are correct
   * %PURPLE% L.473-374: Why is there a +-10% uncertainty added for the W+jets cross section, while the corresponding background contribution has been determined from a data control region?
      * The control regions just provide information on where the cross section value should lie within this uncertainty. They don't determine anything about the contributions themselves, W+jets is always estimated using MC.
   * %PURPLE% L.475, "statistical uncertainty": really only "statistical", isn't this supposed to cover the entire uncertainty on QCD background?
      * The uncertainty I'm describing here is a (fully statistical) uncertainty on the transfer factors used to estimate the nominal normalization of the QCD background in each channel: the magnitude of the uncertainty is directly dependent only on the numbers of observed events in each sideband region.
   * %GREEN% Table 1, the column heading "Scale" seems somewhat unusual and easy to misinterpret. Maybe better "Average size"?
      * Changed this to "size" and explain it in the caption
   * %GREEN% Table 2: The p-values for the measurements of d and mu in the 12 (!) different regions are mostly very close to 1. This must be explained in the paper, because from the present description it is unclear how such an unphysical result could happen.
      * This was indeed an issue; it was related to my accounting of signal vs. background processes in combine for the d and mu fits in particular. I've switched to using the "saturated" test statistic for goodness of fit, and the p-values calculated over all signal regions are 0.206, 0.233, and 0.274 for the fits for Afb, d, and mu, respectively. The next version of the paper draft will include this information, and the AN will be updated with the plots showing how the test-statistic values for fits to data are well-distributed within those observed for pseudo-experiments.
   * %GREEN% L.534-537 is very convoluted and should be simplified or split in two sentences.

   * %PURPLE% Given that this is mainly a search for BSM effects, it seems difficult to justify not including 2017+2018 data to a referee. The A_fb appears to be completely statistics limited, and for the other parameters the statistical errors are similar to the systematics. So the additional data should give improved sensitivity to deviations from the SM.
      * I agree! This work would absolutely be better with the whole Run 2 dataset included. There are two reasons we have not done so at this time. First, the method itself is novel and remains unpublished. Second, I am the only person who has worked on this analysis; it's my thesis project and I need to graduate. 
   * %GREEN% Title: It would be more effective if it could be shortened and more to the point. For example: "Forward-backward asymmetry in top quark events in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV"
   * %GREEN% abstract, last sentence: "The forward-backward ...comparable...measurements." It is not clear what you are referring to. Presumably the comparison is to the d and mu values. Why not just say that? It could be replaced by: "Results on d and mu are comparable to those obtained at the Tevatron." In general, comparison to Tevatron results is not straightforward. It would be better to remove the sentence from the abstract. It would fit better in the conclusions.
      * In my opinion, none of the comparisons are straightforward. I've been wanting to remove this for some time.
   * %PURPLE% L16: It would be good to clarify earlier what is the final state used for the study.
      * It's in the abstract that we're using lepton+jets events
   * %GREEN% LL20-21: it would be good to add a sketch
   * %GREEN% L22: There is also a 13 TeV paper submitted (http://inspirehep.net/record/1742786?ln=en), that should presumably be cited here. Unfortunately it seems nearly impossible to compare to those previous CMS results, since they use a different notation (+ different theory formalism?), and quote 95% CL limits instead of a central value with 1-sigma errors. It would have been extremely helpful to present the results in a way that could be directly compared. If that's not possible, at least some statement explaining how the sensitivity of this result compares to previous limits on the chromo-E/M moments seems mandatory.
      * Added some text to the end of the results section comparing the measurements
   * %GREEN% L22: odd and even distributions: not clear what that means in this context. Please clarify.
      * I think linking the following sentence to this helps clarify.
   * %GREEN% L27: NLO ...expected to produced ... positive values for AFB. How is this relevant? "small" should be quantified. AFB is expected to be symmetric at 13 TeV. The quark-related interactions are a small fraction at LO, and even smaller at NLO.
      * We added "on the order of 5%" to quantify how large the effects are, though the exact value depends on the calculation. The rest of this comment is unclear to us...AFB is not "symmetric" in the SM.
   * %GREEN% L37: A_C is a different measurement. It is not clear why A_C "uses only a fraction of the available information". Please clarify.
      * I think the explanation of this is better now.
   * %GREEN% L38: done-> performed
   * %GREEN% LL38-40: rather than "model-independent" and "simplified model", it would be better to mention that here the goal is to model the different qq, qg, and gg contributions with the goal of isolating the different components.
      * I think the new version of this is more clear.
   * %PURPLE% LL45-51: The formulation is hard to follow. Is this necessary? It would be better to describe the measurement from the point of view of the observables.
      * I think it's necessary to keep this here to explain the relation between A_FB and A_FB^(1); it defines what we mean by "linearized."
   * %GREEN% Eq.3: many terms are not defined. Is this really needed?
      * I made sure all the terms are defined, and changed some of the variable names to be less ambiguous. This expression really does need to be included though to make perfectly clear which definition of the parameters we're using.
   * %PURPLE% L59: why the subscript 1? The observable is defined in Eq. 1.
      * This is to distinguish the linearized from the parton-level quantity as explained in lines 46-51
   * %GREEN% L67: how does this measurement compare to those in Ref.22, in terms of accuracy? Please clarify it in the Summary.
   * %PURPLE% L78: more challenging -> less sensitive ?
      * I think "more challenging" is indeed the point we're trying to make. We're not necessarily less sensitive, depending on statistics and many other factors, but there will always be the hurdle of ttbar production being primarily gg and not qqbar since we're in a pp lab not a ppbar one.
   * %GREEN% L85: what are the "Drell-Yan variables"? why not just "the following variables... "? Please clarify.
      * No need. Removed "Drell-Yan" as it was confusing several people.
   * %PURPLE% LL90-91: In Fig.2 there are 4 distributions. Please add description of all 4.
      * The last one isn't a distribution, but that plot is explained in lines 98-105.
   * %GREEN% L92: It is not clear the logic. "smaller" it certainly is, but it would be good to quantify. The combination of qg and gg is probably because there is little (or no) added sensitivity to the measurement. Yet, the asymmetry in qg may still provide some information. Suggest to either simply state that the qg and gg are combined as they provide negligible sensitivity or to quantify what is "small".
      * It's about two orders of magnitude smaller; we added this information in.
   * %GREEN% L98: May want to clarify the reason. At LHC, g and qbar come from the sea and are softer.
      * I think the way this has been reworded is more clear than the original.
   * %GREEN% L99: Please remove "much".
   * %GREEN% L105: what is "CM frame"? please clarify.
      * Removed this abbreviation everywhere since it was only used three or four times and is confusing.
   * %GREEN% Fig.2: are the distributions normalized to unity? if so, please state it.
      * Added this in the caption.
   * %PURPLE% Also, distribution in lower right panel: please describe the variable and define it in the text and in the caption.
      * this variable is defined on line 104, and I've been asked explicitly by the ARC and LE to not repeat its definition in the caption.
   * %PURPLE% Eq.4 and Eq.5: What is the relation between the two? Are they both really needed? Eq.4 is at NLO and Eq.5 includes the anomalous parameters. However, from Eq.5 one does not get Eq.4 after setting d=mu=0. It is not clear.
      * They describe different cross section extensions for the AFB and d/mu measurements, and we make that more clear later on explaining that the equations are used for independent analyses.
   * %GREEN% L116: not straightforward that "large beta" means "large pair mass". Also, what is "pair mass"? Please clarify.
      * Beta and mttbar are directly related, but I agree it was hard before to see that "pair mass" means mttbar. I've made that more clear.
   * %GREEN% general: Eq4/5 is qq and Eq6 is gg. It is missing the contribution of qg. Why?
      * Equation 6 is tree-level; the extensions we add are approximately NLO but make no distinction between gg and qg in construction. This is explained shortly after the presentation of the equations.
   * %GREEN% L120: "dipole moments". Are you referring to d and mu? it would be good to clarify earlier these are dipole moments.
      * I changed "anomalous dipole moments" to just "d and mu," but they are defined as dipole moments the very first time they're used, on line 53.
   * %GREEN% L122: "the first of the three". What is that? Not clear. Better to replace with something like: Three ttbar decay topologies are considered. The first uses two "fat" jets, in which the decay products of the top or tbar are merged in single jets.
      * I don't know if I agree with this. We state on line 64 that there will be three distinct topologies considered, and the point I'm making in this sentence is justifying inclusion of the first of those. This language has been improved slightly, though.
   * %GREEN% L123: "second topology". Later it is referred to type-2. Please specify it here as well. The same applies to the all 3 topologies.
      * This whole paragraph is structured better now.
   * %PURPLE% L154: at this point one would expect to know which triggers have been used. However, they only appear at L208. It would be good to move that here.
      * I was asked to move the trigger efficiencies to the systematics section, but I believe the listing of the triggers used belongs in event selection as it is. 
   * %GREEN% L154 and Table 1: So the boosted e+jets trigger efficiency is much higher than the resolved e+jets, but the systematic error on the boosted trigger is ~7x larger than on the resolved? Given that the boosted e+jets trigger is by far the largest systematic effect in the table, it would be nice to add some comment on what is driving this. 
      * I added the sentence "The precision of the boosted {\Pe}+jets trigger efficiency measurement is limited by the number of events passing selection criteria."
   * %GREEN% L194: Not needed to use both "modified mass drop tagger" and "soft drop". Use only one name for the algorithm.
   * %PURPLE% LL195-196: the names "angular exponent", "soft cutoff", "characteristic radius" do not mean much to the reader. It would be preferable to write what these values represent without having to read the Ref.
      * This text is boilerplate from the publication TWiki; I'm loathe to change it from that.
   * %PURPLE% L199: bosonic -> W/Z boson
      * This text is also boilerplate
   * %PURPLE% L209: Trigger: single muon pT>50 GeV, single ele pT>115GeV. These are non-isolated leptons. The efficiency for ttbar events for these triggers depends on the boost of the tops. How is this accounted for?
      * The efficiency scalefactors applied depend on the lepton kinematics as describe in the systematics section... is that what this question is asking???
   * %GREEN% LL236-238: It is not clear whether only one leg or both legs are considered separately. Please clarify.
      * This was missing an Oxford comma; I think that helps.
   * %GREEN% L239: "decaying with very high momentum" is confusing. What is high is the momentum of the initial top such that the decay products are boosted. Please rephrase.
      * This line is gone now
   * %GREEN% L241: "either a partially- or fully-merged..." is not clear. "partially-merged"? What is a partially or fully merged hadronic top decay? Are you referring to "top hadronic decay products"? Is it partially- or fully-merged?
      * Also gone
   * %GREEN% Also, if it is fully-merged, it does not fit into the other type-1 category?
      * It could  be fully-merged, but if it doesn't pass the top-tagging criteria then the event is not in the type-1 category. I explain this better now in the section I initially introduce this idea.
   * %GREEN% L243: "lower mass events": this is jargon. What does it mean? does it refer to m_ttbar? It is not clear.
      * Also gone
   * %PURPLE% L248: muon/ele candidates have pT>50/80 GeV for boosted events. Are these values compatible with the triggers at L209? What are the efficiencies?
      *  Yes, these values were chosen specifically to sync with the triggers used and the selections used to measure their efficiencies. The trigger efficiencies are given in the paper, but selection efficiencies for these cuts are listed in the AN in the cutflow tables. I don't think it's common to mention the efficiency of individual selections beyond triggers. 
   * %PURPLE% L272: it would be useful to clarify what is the top-tagging efficiency in the kinematic regions relevant to this analysis.
      * Same case as the above: it varies depending on selection region, and I don't have the measurements readily available. Again this seems like too much text to me.
   * %GREEN% L291: Are the Refs needed? they are specific for what?
      * I think so. One of them is the source of the functional form used in the kinematic fit, and the other is for Minuit, which we use to actually do the fit.
   * %GREEN% L309: "leptonic top quark mass" is jargon. Are you referring to the leptonic leg? It may be good to define "leptonic/hadronic leg" or "leptonic/hadronic branch" earlier and then use it consistently.
      * Changed this to "leptonically-decaying top quark mass"
   * %GREEN% L310: form -> define
   * %GREEN% L310: constraining -> used to constrain
   * %GREEN% L312: what is c^star_tau? it was not defined. Please clarify.
      * It's a subscript "r" for "reconstructed;" I define this much more clearly now.
   * %GREEN% L312: what is a Drell-Yan variable? Please clarify (this comment also applies to other similar instances).
   * %GREEN% L317: the sign of the lepton -> the sign of the lepton charge
   * %PURPLE% Figs. 3-5: It would be helpful to also show an example of how the ttbar shapes look for a non-SM scenario, for some choice of d/mu parameters close to your sensitivity.
      * We do not think that adding a new figure showing these effects contributes enough to the reader's understanding to justify including it; it's not a very illustrative plot.
   * %GREEN% Fig.3/4/5, caption: what is "full" in this context? please clarify or remove.
      * removed
   * %GREEN% Fig.3/4/5: the last bin includes the overflows? please clarify in the caption.
      * The last bins of the abs(x_r) and m_r plots do include overflow, I explain that in the caption now.
   * %GREEN% Fig.4, Type2: middle (x_f): there is a disagreement and the ratio shows a slope. It is strange that this does not appear for the electrons. How is this understood? It would be good to add a sentence in the text addressing this.
      * This is due to the PDF uncertainty, and it gets corrected in the full fit that includes systematic nuisances. Added some text explaining this.
   * %GREEN% Fig.5, Type3: x_f, the slope now appears for both electrons and muons. What is the dependence of x_f on the jet p_T?
      * This is the same effect as above; you'd see it for type-1/2 electrons as well if the statistical precision was better. 
   * %BLUE% L325: It would be good to check if there are recent studies from the TRK or MUO POGs that could be cited to support this, instead of just saying the efficiency symmetry is assumed.
      * We're going to talk to some colleagues in alignment about this.
   * %GREEN% L383: ABCD: The discussion is confusing as it is. Also, as it is, there is no much point in giving the specifics of the A, B, C regions. It would be good to add a sketch to explain this, and better define the regions in isolation and ptmiss. It would help.
      * I've completely reworked this paragraph. It no longer depends on the explicit definitions of the sidebands, and I think it's much clearer overall.
   * %GREEN% L496 and Fig. 6: It seems for d, the Best fit value is degenerate for True values between about -0.01 and 0.01. If this is true, could you add an explaination of how the True value is determined to be 0.002 for a Best fit value of 0?
      * Our analysis isn't very sensitive to small values of d, and the fitting function includes an inherent sign ambiguity. For these reasons we've changed our measurement of d to quote unsigned 68% and 95% limits on the absolutely value of d, based on a likelihood scan rather than a Neyman construction.
   * %GREEN% Fig. 6: It's not clear what is going on with the 2-sigma band around true mu=-0.04, where it becomes very wide vertically.
      * That's just the distribution of the values from the toy experiments; if the plot were wider it would be on the other side as well. I don't have any further "explanation" for this. The plot is slightly different in the new version, maybe showing more clearly how the uncertainty on the parameters is simply larger for small values.
   * %GREEN% Table 2: The many p-values of 1.000 for d and mu seem suspicious - can you add some comment to the text on how you interpret this?
      * This is no longer the case; I changed the test-statistic I was using, and some book-keeping things in the combine fits, and now the p-values are not suspicious at all.
   * %GREEN% L488-492: How much does the assumption of fixing the other 2 parameters to 0/the MC values matter? Would larger values of mu be allowed if d was allowed to vary simultaneously, for example? If so, it should somehow be made more clear in the Results/Summary section that the results are valid for that particular assumption on the other parameters.
      * The effects of A_FB are entirely orthogonal to those of mu and d. I added references to the equations we use to estimate the cross sections, which should make the independence of the parameters more obvious to readers.
   * %GREEN% L522: This sentence sounds like it's making excuses for not generating more MC. Please consider rephrasing, or even removing it, if it's not one of the main points that readers should take away from the paper.
   * %PURPLE% L531: in the summary only two categories appear, as "resolved" and "boosted", whereas the paper always refers to 3 categories. Please make it consistent.
      * The first two categories are both "boosted." The language here mirrors that used in the abstract.
   * %GREEN% L536: Please add a comparison to results in earlier measurements. For example: those in [22] or in the ATLAS+CMS combined results JHEP 04(2018)033.

From Dick Loveless:
   * %GREEN% Title: I suggest removing "Template" and writing "measurements" in plural.  I would also delete "in the senileptonic channel" and add "in proton-proton collisions".  Thus it would read "Measurements of the top quark forward-backward asymmetry and the anomalous chromoeletric and chromomagnetic moments in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV".
   * %GREEN% line 3:  Change "top quark's Yukawa coupling" to "Yukawa coupling of the top quark".
   * %GREEN% line 7:  Define SM here by writing " . . standard model (SM) of particle physics . . ".
   * %GREEN% line 8:  Move "predominantly" to after "produced".
   * %PURPLE% line 10:  Isn't this a "process" and not a subprocess".  Shouldn't all occurrences of "subprocess" become "process"? 
      * We think it's important to make the distinction that the "process" is pp to ttbar, and that the different "subprocesses" can be separated to an order of approximation.
   * %PURPLE% Fig. 1 caption:  Change "subprocesses" to "processes" etc.
   * %GREEN% line 17:  Add a comma before "where".
   * %GREEN% line 20:  Add hyphens to "initial-state" and "final-state".
   * %PURPLE% line 28:  Change "sub-processes" to "processes".
   * %GREEN% line 32:  Change "appeared to be" to "were". 
   * %GREEN% line 33:  Add "the" before "NLO" and change the comma after "expectation" to a semicolon.
   * %GREEN% line 35:  Delete "have"
   * %GREEN% line 36:  Add a comma after "A_C" and change "that" to "which" and add a comma after "states".
   * %GREEN% line 38:  Add "existing" before ""A_FB" and change "done to date have been" to "are".
   * %GREEN% line 39:  End the sentence with "approach" and start a new sentence with "A simplified model . . ".
      * I restructured this to have a new sentence starting with "This work represents..." which came from another reviewer and which I think is best.
   * %GREEN% line 40:  Change "adopted, allowing" to "adopted that allows".
   * %PURPLE% line 41:  Change "subprocesses" to "processes".
   * %GREEN% line 42:  Maybe put quotes around "beyond the SM processes".
   * %GREEN% line 44:  Add a comma after "angle".
   * %GREEN% line 48:  Add a hyphen to "leading-order".
      * changed to LO now that that's defined above.
   * %PURPLE% lines 80,82,84,85,90,92:  Change "subprocesses" to "processes".
   * %GREEN% lines 91, 105:  Delete "note that".
   * %GREEN% line 120:  Delete the hyphen in "nonzero".
   * %GREEN% line 122: Delete "considered".
   * %GREEN% line 123:  Do you mean each t quark and tbar quark produce "a single jet"?  or do they produce one single jet?  Based on the remainder of the paragraph I think you should change "single jets" to a single jet".
      * I agree this is unclear. I reworded this whole sentence.
   * %GREEN% line 124:  Change "considers" to "consists of".
   * %GREEN% line 133:  Maybe delete "Truth".  
      * Changed this to "The generator-level information"
   * %GREEN% line 169:  Delete "taken to be".
   * %GREEN% lines 175,176:  Delete "from from simulation to be".
   * %GREEN% line 177: Add "based on simulation." after "acceptance".
   * %GREEN% line 179:  Delete "identified to be".
   * %GREEN% line 180:  Add a comma after "discarded" and change "correct" to "account".
   * %GREEN% line 181:  Delete "that".
   * %GREEN% line 182:  Add a hyphen to "particle-level".
   * %GREEN% line 183:  Change "determine" to "detect".  You don't determine the differences, you observe them and then correct.
   * %GREEN% line 188:  Change "for which" to "where".
      * updated boilerplate text no longer has this issue
   * %GREEN% lines 189-192:  It is not necessary to introduce a slang term (cleaning).  Write " . . each jet has removed the momenta . .  Muons are removed from jets . . .electrons are removed from jets . . .".
   * %GREEN% line 193:  Add "the" before "jet radius".
   * %GREEN% lines 199,200:  Add a comma after "events" and change "comprising uniquely jets produced through" to "which consist of jets produced via . . ".  End the sentence with "events.  Start a new sentence "This improves the jet mass . . ".
   * %GREEN% line 203:  Add "the" before "reconstruction".
   * %GREEN% line 206:  Change "has been" to "is".
   * %GREEN% line 208:  Change "are those passing" to "pass".
   * %GREEN% line 210:  Change "on" to "for" after "thresholds".
   * %GREEN% line 211:  Add a comma after "pt".
   * %GREEN% line 217:  The phrase "as they are halved and doubled [43.44]" does not belong here.  Move it to the discussion of uncertainty (line 404).
   * %GREEN% line 228:  Change "MC samples used" to "These MC samples".
   * %GREEN% line 232:  Change "used have been" to "are".
   * %GREEN% line 236:  Delete the comma after "topologies" and change "in which" to "where".
   * %GREEN% line 238:  Delete "are those identified to".
      * these few sentences are gone since we define "type-1/2/3" events higher up in the next version.
   * %GREEN% lines 239,240:  Suggest deleting "top quark's".

   * %GREEN% line 189 This phrase sounds a bit convoluted, maybe would be better to rephrase it to something along this:“each jet has subtracted (“cleaned”) from it the momenta of any leptons within it.” -> “leptons reconstructed and identified within jets are not taken into account in the jet momentum computation. This procedure is called “cleaning”.”
      * I got other suggestions on this too, and ended up dropping the slang "cleaning" altogether. Love this sentence structure, though, thanks for that!!

From Dick Loveless:
   * %PURPLE% Abstract, lines 11-13:  Does this measurement agree with Tevatron measurements? Line 520 says it agrees, so the sentence should read "This forward-backward asymmetry measurement agrees with Tevatron experiments.".
      * I actually removed this sentence from the abstract; I don't think a direct comparison is possible to make.
   * %GREEN% line 47:  Why is it necessary to set "A_FB" to "A_FB^1"?  In line 25 why not define "A_FB" as the linearized forward-backward asymmetry", change Eq. (2) to "A_FB" and delete the sentence on line 47?  In lines 50 and 59 "A_FB^1" appears again so obviously I (and the reader) are missing some important clarification.
      * The distinction we make is between the parton-level quantity and the apprxoimately linearized quantity. We changed the language around this; it should be clearer now.
   * %GREEN% line 60:  What is a "template description of the total cross section"?  Is this a theoretical distribution of the expected cross section as a function of A_FB, d, and mu?  How about writing "The analysis matches a theoretical description of the total cross section as a function of A_FB, d, and mu with a sample of ttbar-enriched events . . .".
      * Agreed, love this wording, too.
   * %GREEN% line 64:  What are the "three distinct topologies"?  Is it important to explain this in the Introduction?  It is covered in lines 120-129.  I suggest you simply drop "with three distinct topologies" in the introduction.
      * Agreed
   * %GREEN% line 388:  What is "non-QCD MC contamination?
      * I improved this entire paragraph by a wide margin; this is much clearer now.
   * %GREEN% line 404:  This is the location to add the phrase removed from line 217.
From Camilla Galloni:
   * %GREEN% line 3-4: “The top  quark’s Yukawa coupling to the Higgs potential is close to unity” can you insert a reference?  
      * Will cite the PDG here.
   * %PURPLE% line 87 : “ longitudinal momentum pL “ by longitudinal do you mean parallel to the beam pipe? Not clear to me also from what is written in line 99-102. Could you improve a bit the description since is one of the main ingredients of the analysis?
      * The p_L symbol is standard, according to the guidelines it doesn't need a definition any longer.
   * %PURPLE% line 165: is it possible to put a reference for “zero-suppression”? I’m not sure how much that is jargon. 
      * This is boilerplate text from the publication guidelines TWiki.
   * %PURPLE% line 278: No tau21= tau2/tau1 is applied to select Type 2 events? It should increase the purity of events in which an hadronic decaying W boson originates a large con jet. 
      * I looked at this, and found that the W-tagging requirement didn't bridge the gap between the other two event categories as smoothly as just using the resolved jets for type-2 events, even if they might have a merged W. Requiring even a loose W-tag also decreased the selection efficiency, which was already pretty low for type-2 events.
   * %GREEN% line 299:  in line 240  it’s stated that ““Type-2” events are those for which the  presence of a large, high-momentum, high-mass jet indicates either a partially- or fully-merged hadronic top quark decay”. Instead from line 299  it would seem that you ignore AK8 jets for the hadronic top reconstruction for Type 2 events “Type-2 and type-3 events ignore AK8 jets entirely in their reconstruction, and instead assign each of the four or five AK4 jets with the highest pT either to the leptonic or hadronic side of the decay, or neither, with b-tagged jets in place.”. Please clarify.
      * I think the way I've worded this now is better.
   * %GREEN% line 502: Can an explanation about the 1 and 2 sigma lines irregularities for  the d and mu plots be added? The toy median functions are much more monotone than the 1 and 2 sigma bands.

   * What do you mean by "linearized"? I suppose that AFB(1) refers to some 1st-degree truncation in some sort of polynomial expansion, but in what is the expansion performed?
      * %ORANGE% Morris can answer this question in greater detail than myself, but in the analysis note the model is explained as "a linear forward-backward asymmetry (such as could be caused by several kinds of new physics that interfere with or augment the tree-level process)" (lines 56-58 in the AN) and the two papers cited are linked at [[https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.81.114004][1]] and [[https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.83.114027][2]]. Several models are presented in these papers that could extend the standard model top pair cross section, and their effects are considered in several different ways including effective field theories or effective couplings. Across the board, however, the extensions end up as some functions of the same cos(theta) we present in our paper (sometimes more clearly than others). I do not know how the exact extension we use to parameterize the asymmetric portion of the cross section (eq. 2 in the paper draft, eq. 8 in the AN) was decided on because I'm not sure of the exact correspondence of some numerical factors, but it bears a likeness to the terms in the extended cross section formulae that are dependent on cos(theta) to first order only. I think this is the best answer I can give you at the moment, but hopefully when Morris gets back from vacation he can help me understand better and we can get back to you again.

   * I think that POWHEG v1, not v2, was used for the tW sample (and only for it; v2 for all the rest), for reasons that I used to know. But I may be wrong, so please check.
      * %GREEN% You're correct about this; it totally slipped my mind. I'll make a note of this and change it in the next draft of the paper and the analysis note. Thank you for your detailed eye and I apologize for my error.

   * Figure 7: I understand that when you say "MC uncertainties" you mean the systematic uncertainties that affect the shape of the MC distributions, right? (I am asking because in the usual jargon we use that term for the statistical uncertainty due to the finite size of the MC sample.) When you say "are fully correlated statistical+systematic", what do you mean? Fully correlated between what?
      * %ORANGE% By "MC uncertainties" I am referring to the hashed grey error bars on the stacked MC template histograms in the plots; they are the total combined, post-fit, statistical+systematic uncertainties determined by fits through the combine tool, which is what I was trying to get at by saying "statistical+systematic", and by "fully correlated" I meant that the results are shown with a full treatment of the correlations of the systematic nuisance parameters across the appropriate channels as described in Section 6 of the paper (Section 9 of the AN) as well as with one another. I was trying to say "The hashed grey error bars show the total post-fit template uncertainties in each bin due to statistical as well as systematic uncertainties," but I don't like my language here either. Is there a better way to get the point across that the error bars are post-fit, not pre-fit, and that they show the total uncertainty, not just the statistical uncertainty (like what's shown in the control plots in figs. 3-5 in the paper draft)?

General comments: 

   * The first 5 pages describe the observables of the search/measurement. I  think in some places, in particular the first two pages it could be  better organized. I wonder if we can omit some of the equations... like  Eq. 6 and 7.  I assume these are taken from Ref. 16 and if the reader wants can check them. I find he theory introduction longer also taking into account the length of the experimental part of the discussion given in the paper.
      * %ORANGE% I've spoken to Morris about reorganizing this information better but he is not sure the best way to pare down the discussion and has suggested that we wait for other feedback or more explicit suggestions? We're worried about losing equations 6 and 7 for sake of clarity....

   * Throughout the paper you need to iron out the usage of jargon  expressions like "muon events", "boosted events", "dileptonic ttBar events", "semileptonic tt","templating", ... If you want to use these in the paper you need to first define at the first use case.
      * %GREEN% I've gone line-by-line through the paper and removed a lot of unnecessary jargon. Anything that I do use is defined at first use now.

   * Please add discussion on the trigger selection efficiency in each category and on how it is measured. In lines that follow 385, you state the kinematic dependent SFs are applied... But I think for such an analysis it is important to state how large are those SFs and how they change across the observables that are fitted, and overall what are the trigger efficiencies we have.
      * %GREEN% There are more details about all of this in the AN, but I tried to incorporate some key numbers in the paper draft as well. Added details on average trigger efficiency to end of "Detector" section: "The average selection efficiencies of the triggers applied to data are approximately 95\% (97\%) in the boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets channels and approximately 98\% (74\%) in the boosted (resolved) electron+jets channels." Also added details about trigger SF measurements to section on systematics: "The average values of the scalefactors applied are about 0.94 (0.96) for boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets events and about 0.98 for boosted and resolved electron+jets events. The $\mu$+jets scalefactors were measured by the Muon Physics Object Group \cite{muon_eff_twiki}. The boosted electron+jets scalefactors were measured by the Top Physics Analysis Group \cite{electron_trigger_eff_twiki} and the resolved electron+jets scalefactors were measured by analysts in the Beyond the Second Generation subgroup \cite{andrey_electron_trigger_sfs}."

   * A general comment for section 8: It would be interesting to give some quantitative range for each uncertainty source. Either the input uncertainties or the range of the systematic effect in the templates... You may also consider adding a new column in table 1. You can see how it is done in other analyses such as TOP-18-009 syst. table in the paper draft.
      * %GREEN% I added another column to the table in Section 6 of v2 of the paper and Section 9 of v9 of the analysis note to illustrate this. The column lists for each systematic the mean of the absolute values of the percent content changes observed in each affected process's template bins, quantifying the scale of each uncertainty effect.

   * Also to my taste the length of how the templates are constructed for each background source is not detailed enough. For QCD templates you derive several transfer factors. But you do not discuss their size and dependence on the template shapes. I suggest to extend on this with a  few sentences. 
      * %GREEN% The isolation and MET cuts used to define the QCD estimate sidebands are not correlated with the template observables nor with each other. To quantify the transfer factors I added at the end of the sentence describing them in  the "Background Estimation" section: "The transfer factors are applied to each of the events in the shape sidebands to renormalize the templates to the expected numbers of events in the full signal regions; their values are approximately 0.004 (0.46), 0.003 (0.35), and 0.37 (1.44) in the type-1, type-2, and type-3 signal region $\mu$(electron)+jets channels respectively."

   * Also, it is not clear if W+jets background normalizations  in Q=+ and - are independently let varied or their normalization is constrained by one nuisance.  This is important given that W+ and W- production are not symmetric.
      * %GREEN% In our current treatment there is only one scalefactor, correlated across both charges. I wanted the associated nuisance parameter to basically correct/constrain the overal W+Jets cross section measurement, so I didn't make it charge-dependent (this is also the case for Rbck scaling the other ttbar, single top, and DY+Jets background processes).

   * The results section needs to focus on more the description of the  results  rather than the technical details of the fit. So technical  details are necessary but as it is the section needs further elaboration  on the results putting them into the context of bigger picture, commenting on improvements in this analysis, telling about perspectives  of improving if possible in the future etc...
      * %GREEN% This whole section has been overhauled now.


Detailed comments:

   * L8 "top production" --> does not sound good. you can rearrange the sentence to avoid using it. And example... ".. particle physics, at the LHC top quarks are dominantly produced in pairs via the strong interaction as described by Quantum..."
      * %GREEN% Changed sentence to "In the Standard Model of particle physics, top quarks are dominantly produced in pairs at the LHC via the strong interaction as described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)."

   * L11-12: I think here you can give the proportion of the contribution from these processes (gg, qq...) to the final state.
      * %GREEN% Added "NLO QCD calculations predict approximately 6\% \qqbar, 69\% \glu, and 25\% \qg production of top pairs."

   * L14: needs a reference.
      * %GREEN% Added reference as requested.

   * Figure 2: I might have asked this before, but the bottom right plot includes also gg initial states ? Probably not because otherwise it would be much smaller given that qqbar initial state constitutes only ~10% of the total x-section. If this figure shows only the qqBar initial state cases then it should be clarified otherwise it is misleading. Additionally, these figures use Gen-level top kinematics right ? If yes, please also clarify that.
      * %GREEN% You are correct on both points: the bottom right plot does not include gg initial states, and they all use gen-level top kinematics. This is now stated in the caption.

   * Figure 2 caption: suggest to remove the last sentence it repeats what is written in the text above.
      * %GREEN% done.

   * Figure 2: Please also improve the quality of the bottom-right figure.
      * %GREEN% New CMS style version of this plot availabe in paper v2/note v9.

   * Figure 2: M--> m, also in the text. I also suggest to change it to m(ttBar)  or m_{ttBar}
      * %GREEN% Changed "M" to "m_{ttbar}" everywhere in the paper

   * L64-65 "..beyond the Standard Model processes" --> "Beyond the SM processes"
      * %GREEN% done.

   * L88: suggest not to use i, j as j is used in equation 3 for various background processes I assume. Please make the definition of j explicit too.
      * %GREEN% Changed flavor indices to a,b instead of i,j. Which definition of "j" is unclear?

   * Eq.4. Please explain this equation (and motivation for anti-symmetrisation) by connecting to Eq. 2. I assume this is related to the two parts of the x-section one having only c^2 and the other c  factors ? Just for curiosity and sanity check have you shown the distributions of y where the symmetric and antisymmetric parts sum to the original template ?
      * %GREEN% Indeed, it's the ratio of the c^2 to c portions of the cross sections; added a quick explanation of this. I have not shown that the decomposition sums to the original prediction; I'm not sure if we'd even expect that based on the generated MC? Maybe we can follow up on this in a setting where we can talk in more detail?

   * Eq.6,  c^* at the denominator
      * %GREEN% fixed.

   * - "lepton+jets final states" --> This is rather jargon. Please define it at the first use case.
      * %GREEN% first use found on line 75; changed "...from lepton+jets final states, in which..." to "...from final states containing a single lepton and several hadronic jets, called \"lepton+jets," in which..."
  
   * L 120-129: This is a good place to state what is new (other than new  data) in this analysis wrt. earlier LHC publications. Please point to  the unique features of this measurement wrt the older ones.  You may also bring the references & description of the earlier LHC measurements from lines 38-39 to here.
      * %GREEN% Added "The measurement of the \qqbar initial state top forward-backward asymmetry is the first of its kind at the LHC and can be directly compared with results from the Tevatron experiments \cite{Aaltonen:2011kc,Abazov:2007ab,Abazov:2014cca,Aaltonen:2016bqv,Aaltonen:2017efp}.  Measurements of the anomalous chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments have previously been extracted from measurements of the \ttbar spin correlations \cite{CMS:2014bea, Khachatryan:2016xws}.  This is the first measurement that relies on the \ttbar differential distributions." to the end of this paragraph.

   * L128-129: the second and third typologies are not well motivated. At this point the reader wonders why one should bother with semi- and fully- resolved tops.
      * %GREEN% Agreed, this was worded kind of funny. Changed "...are one such topology.  A second topology considers events of lower pair mass in which the decay products are partly merged.  Finally, the third category includes the lowest mass events that are fully resolved" to "...are one such topology.  A second topology considers events of lower pair mass in which the decay products are partly merged, bridging the gap between events identifiable as either fully merged or fully resolved.  Finally, the third and most populated category includes the lowest mass events that are fully resolved." This at least explains the roles of the other two selections?

   * L147: Suggest to remove the photon measurement description. It is not used in the analysis.
      * %GREEN% Done; removed "The energy of each photon is obtained from the ECAL measurement."

   * L157: repeats L148 for electron measurement
      * %GREEN% Removed "The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker."

   * L162: "Muons are identified"
      * %GREEN% "measured" --> "identified"

   * L157-148: the information given here is not well structured... I am not sure lepton momentum resolution is a critical information for this  measurement. You give trigger efficiency for muons (before you define the trigger system & triggers used in the analysis) but not for electrons...  reco+id efficiency is given only for muons and not for electrons.
      * %GREEN% Removed lepton momentum resolution information. Moved "Muons are identified in the pseudorapidity range $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers." to the paragraph above about PF. Trigger efficiencies are not given in the last paragraph of this section for both muons & electrons ("The average selection efficiencies of the triggers applied to data are approximately 95\% (97\%) in the boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets channels and approximately 98\% (74\%) in the boosted (resolved) electron+jets channels.")
   
   * L173-174: pT_miss used in the PV selection and the ETmiss that is used in the event are not the same. One is explicitly using only tracks that  originate from a particular PV while the other is using PF objects that include neutrals as well.
      * %GREEN% Changed "The energy associated with this \ptvecmiss, called missing transverse energy or \MET," to "The energy of the negative vector sum of all PF objects, called missing transverse energy or \MET,"

   * L190: not clear what you mean with “of any muons whose singular PF candidates it shares”
      * %GREEN% Changed "...each jet has subtracted (``cleaned") from it the momenta of any electrons spatially within it and of any muons whose singular PF candidates it shares." to "...each jet has subtracted (``cleaned") from it the momenta of any leptons within it. Muons are cleaned from jets using key-based cleaning, wherein a muon's fourvector is subtracted from that of a reconstructed jet if the muon's PF candidate appears in the list of jet PF candidates, and electrons are cleaned from jets by subtracting their fourvectors from those of any reconstructed jets within spatial separation $\DR$ less than jet radius."
   
   * L202-207: suggest to move to the end of section 2 lines around 144.
      * %GREEN% This paragraph now comes right before the paragraph about PF stuff

   * L250: "Lepton candidates in the boosted (resolved) regions are required to have pT > 50(30)GeV" 50 GeV is not enough to get events beyond the  turn-on curve of the lepton trigger efficiency in particular for electrons in boosted regimes. The trigger thresholds given in lines are 50 GeV, and for electrons in particular is the case only in the presence of a high pT jet.
      * %GREEN% Bumped this cut up to 80 GeV to synchronize with trigger efficiency measurement for AN v9/paper v2

   * L253: Suggest to include a sentence  for to what "isolation" refers and why it is needed. Start with defining/justifying it for resolved  scenario then say it is modified for boosted scenario.
      * %GREEN% Added the sentence "To ensure that leptons observed in an event correspond to particles in the final decay state rather than products of hadronization, leptons are required to be isolated from nearby hadronic activity in the event." I don't want to switch around the order in which I talk about the algorithms, though, because resolved events are required to pass the 2D cut as well.

   * L258: remove "and" in "photon and..."
      * %GREEN% Done

   * L261: "any event containing" remove S
      * %GREEN% Done (also "are" --> "is")

   * L262 "dileptonic tt decays" is also jargon
      * %GREEN% Changed "...from dileptonic \ttbar decays" to "...from \ttbar decays in which both tops decay to final state leptons"

   * L264: "muon (electron) events" --> "Events with a muon(electron)..."
      * %GREEN% Done

   * Figures 3-5: need to fix the caption. "Transverse momentum (left) and pseudorapidity (right) of lepton (top) and..."  right --> middle and you  need to add Nbjet.  
      * %GREEN% Done

   * Figures 3-5: Also please remove ttBar-hadronic as it contributes super negligible and its color is indistinguishable from ttBar-dileptonic... I assume you do not use separate templates for these two. You can call it "ttBar other" in the leggend and use that label in the text to define in lines 340.
      * %GREEN% Done, this will be reflected in the next drafts (it affects a lot of plots)

   * L291: I think the reader wonders at this point about the underestimated normalization of the Type-I and Type-II events. I think we need to write a few sentence here giving reference to top_pT modelling issue.
      * %GREEN% These plots look different with the new top pT reweighting scheme; the normalization prediction is much better in the new plots in paper v2/note v9.

   * L304-320: I am not sure if the details of the Kinematic fit is  necessary, in particular the formulas showing chi2 minimization etc... Can you not give a reference and just explain in words the procedure in somewhat shorter way ? Most important here in my opinion is the performance, efficiency/purity that is given in lines  326-328.
      * %GREEN% I pared this down a lot for paper v2. I got rid of the equations and a lot of the unnecessary detail, added some references to CMS work with kinematic fitting, and focused on the performance of the method.

   * L344: "well-estimated contributions" --> not clear to what this refers ? a data control region validation ? good MC statistics ?
      * %GREEN% I removed "and well-estimated". My original point was simply that they don't suffer from the MC statistics issues that the QCD background does, nor the cross section uncertainty coupled with rather dominating contribution of the W+Jets process. "Small" handles that fine I think.

   * L341: Drell-Yan Z/g+jets, I guess you want to put a * on gamma.
      * %GREEN% yep, done!

   * L343: "The top and Z/g+jets..."  --> "The sing-letop and..." ?
      * %GREEN% Clarified my language around this.

   * L347: "less precisely estimated from MC" --> due to statistics or other reasons? Please clarify in the paper.
      * %GREEN% Changed to "because its production cross section is less precisely known from theory"

   * L352: Why not to include the M_t,lep^reco in the paper ? I think this would be a nice plot to show... I assume Figure 6 shows it only for signal ttBar events.  So M_t,lep^reco would be a complementary figure showing the background composition distributed over this observable. I think such a plot in all three categories normalized to total luminosity would be very interesting.
      * %GREEN% Replaced the plots of the btagging multiplicity in figs. 3-5 with M_t,lep^reco instead in v2 of the paper.
   
   * L356: "The QCD multijet background contribution is not well estimated in MC due to its large production cross section but low selection  efficiency,"  --> I suggest to call it low stat in MC. Because otherwise the large x-section&low selection efficiency seems to be the physics reason which is not the case.
      * %GREEN% Changed "...due to its large production cross section but low selection efficiency" to "...due to low statistics"

   * Discuss motivation for modified Lorentzian used in kinematic fit in greater detail in AN
      * %GREEN% Added more clarifying language and a reference to the paper we used to find this. It's a relativistc Breit-Wigner form representing two-body t -> Wb decays where the W resonance is correlated to the top threshold.

   * Discuss separation of MC events by production mechanism using MC truth info in greater detail in AN
      * %GREEN% Added the following subsection (called "Production Mechanism Separation") at the start of "Event Selection" in the AN: "As described in Section~\ref{sec:introduction} above, $t\bar{t}$ signal MC samples are separated not only by the nature of their decay but also by the mechanism of their production. We separate MC events into $q\bar{q}$ and $gg/qg$ categories based on MC truth information about the initial partons in the decay. We choose as the initial partons the two ``hard particles" in MC truth whose daughters are the top quark pair. Events are categorized as $gg$ when both partons have ID 21 (corresponding to gluons); $q\bar{q}$ events are those for which both parton IDs are less than 6 (corresponding to non-top quarks) and sum to zero (indicating opposite charge but matching flavor), and $qg$ events are those with exactly one parton whose ID is 21."

   * Perform a cross-check of data-driven QCD background estimation using QCD MC
      * %GREEN% This is done, please see [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/15.html][this thread on the HN]] for more details and plots.
   
   * Run with/without "Rqqbar" nuisance parameter and quantify deviation from generator value and impact on PoIs
      * %GREEN% Impact plots will be available in next version of documentation, but looking at them right now the Rqqbar nuisance gets pulled about 0.5 sigma (which means 0.5%) from its nominal value, with no constraint on its postfit uncertainty, and the impact of this nuisance on PoIs is negligible (<0.0005 for AFB).

   * Mising parton shower (ISR/FSR/hdamp), underlying event (tune), and color reconnection systematics
      * %GREEN% I've added these.

   * Results for NNLO top pT spectra could be used to derive a theory-based top pT reweighting scheme
      * %GREEN% I've done this (and it looks great!). Additional details in [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/13.html][this HN thread]].
      
   * Nuisance for pileup systematics seems to constrain a bit tightly: why might that be?
      * %GREEN% According to Andrea Marini from Higgs Combine this is to be expected because the pileup uncertainty is conservative. It is common to observe.

   * Comments from Nick on Paper draft v0
      * Eqn 12: I assume that you do not run into any issues with -ve yields here? Are the yields in the regions A, B and C sufficient to avoid that?
         * %GREEN% Correct, we don’t have issues with negative yields because the yields in the A, B, and C regions are indeed sufficient. I tuned the MET cuts in each channel partially to solve this problem!
      * In Section 6 you could probably mention the constraints on these nuisance parameters - eg are they assumed to be log-normal / Gaussian etc ...? It could be added to Table 1 
         * %GREEN% I mention the nuisance constraints briefly in Section 7 (lines 435-438), but I can definitely add them to the Table as well.
      * Fig 9 is very nice - I don't often see this in so much detail however, I am confused perhaps about 1 thing. Are you using here directly the measured value of the parameter as the "test-statistic" ? Often the neyman construction involves using the likelihood outcomes to order the results (actually this is more the Feldman-cousins way). Maybe I am misreading those plots.
         * %GREEN% I gave a presentation in a StatComm meeting about this ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762830/contributions/3170892/attachments/1730085/2795956/statcomm_10_8_2018_neyman_and_gof.pdf][link]]) that has more details than I can include here.
   * From statistics questionnaire: after unblinding I will need to return with something about Goodness of Fit.
      * %GREEN% I've run Goodness of Fit tests using the KS algorithm per-channel. Version 9 of the AN explains and lists those results with plots and in a table of p-values. I presented these results before my datacard greenlight at a Higgs Combine meeting on April 17th ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/788727/contributions/3401374/attachments/1831680/2999825/higgs_combine_4_17_2019_fitting_details.pdf][slides]])

   * Many of my nuisance parameter uncertainties constrain post-fit. In particular:
      * JES/JER
         * %GREEN% I tried splitting these into several contributions to no avail. I also double-checked my templates and fitting methods, and tried smoothing templates to decrease the effect, again with no observed changes. This ended up being the focus of a BIG discussion in HComb, but in the end we decided to estimate these systematic impacts conservatively, using an a-posteriori method rather than relying on template morphing. My initial presentation on all of this to HComb can be found [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762838/contributions/3179852/attachments/1735769/2807459/hcomb_10_17_2018_nuisance_constraints.pdf][here]], and my presentation discussing the results of splitting the contributions among multiple sources, as well as our final a-posteriori treatment, is [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762840/contributions/3208961/attachments/1752395/2839895/hcomb_11_14_2018_a_posteriori_JEC_systematics.pdf][here]]. I'll be using a similar a-posteriori treatment to estimate impacts from parton showering, underlying event, and color reconnection uncertainties since these are also accounted for using independent event samples, which results in overconstraining of the associated nuisance parameters in template morphing.
      * Ren/Fact scale
         * %GREEN% These uncertainties are large prefit; constraints are often observed by analysts.
      * Pileup
         * %GREEN% This uncertainty is also conservative prefit; constraint can be expected.
      * Lumi
         * %GREEN% This constraint was due to correlations with other parameters and is now much less apparent as will be shown in AN v9.
      * R* scale/transfer factors
         * %GREEN% We expect these to constrain as I put in by hand a large prefit uncertainty.
      * b tagging efficiencies
         * %GREEN% I split these contributions by jet flavor (b, c, light) and observed a lessening of the constraints as will be shown in AN v9.
      * boosted electron trigger efficiency
         * %GREEN% This was measured conservatively, but the constraint still seems a bit tight even considering that. It's not too concerning, however, due to the very small impact it makes on the PoIs.
      * top pT reweighting uncertainty
         * %GREEN% We expect this to constrain as its true value should certainly be determined by fits to data. In AN v9 I will show results from theory-driven top pT reweighting, and that the constraint on that nuisance is less severe than what we observed for the older version of top pT reweighting.
      * UPDATE 5/29/2019: Much of how this looks is different now because I've changed to smoothing some systematic templates before fitting. See the slides for my April 2019 update talks listed above for more details.

   * In the boosted regime you write that you use HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT OR HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165. The egamma recommendations for these paths [1] is to use them OR'ed with some HLT_Photon. Otherwise these paths become inefficient for electrons with pt > 300 GeV. Have you checked somehow that these electrons do not play a significant role in the analysis? 
      * %GREEN% I didn't end up OR-ing with a photon trigger in that channel for three reasons. The first is that it wasn't available as one of the triggers I had in my nTuples already, and the second is that there are very few selected events, even without trigger requirements in the boosted regime, with electron pT>300 GeV (a few dozen events). The last is that I spoke with Anastasia Karavdina who performed the trigger efficiency measurement I'm using, and she investigated OR-ing with a photon trigger and found minimal impact on either the selected events or the efficiency measurements (likely because the uncertainties are rather large to begin with).

   * How is ID applied? By hand or via value maps?
      * %GREEN% I apply the ID "by hand" to explicitly bypass the isolation requirements.
   * Are impact parameter cuts applied?
      * %GREEN% They were not originally, but have been added for AN v7.
   * Are you using high-pT-specific ID?
      * %GREEN% I decided against using it to sychronize with the boosted electron trigger efficiency selection.
   * Please add estimated QCD contribution to control plots
      * %GREEN% Added in AN v7
   * Is your selection synchronized with the boosted trigger efficiency measurement selection (AN-2016/255)?

      * %GREEN% Yes, variables are extracted as detailed. Pass conversion veto IS applied and this is now listed in AN v7.
   * Effective area corrections: which values were used?
      * %GREEN% Old values. Since updated to current values listed [[https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/data/Summer16/effAreaElectrons_cone03_pfNeuHadronsAndPhotons_80X.txt][here]] in AN v7.
   * HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf has been prescaled after the 2016D period. Is this taken into account?
      * %GREEN% From Sergio (trigger contact): "In some significant fraction of the lumi after Run2016D the lowest unprescaled seed for HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf_v had a higher threshold than the HLT threshold, but the path itself was not prescaled. Therefore you will loose some efficiency at low pT. However what you are doing is not wrong, as long as you are using Andrey's scale factors ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/604912/contributions/2490011/attachments/1418869/2173471/2017.02.27_EGM_Ele25-and-Ele27-trigger-SF_v1.pdf][link]])."

      * %GREEN% I am also not sure what to cite for my trigger choices? Mohsen says it's not a big deal, it just might come up with the ARC.
   * L336-364: for all regions, apply medium ID but tight isolation?
      * %GREEN% I apply medium ID in all regions, yes, but two different sets of isolation criteria for boosted/resolved events. Boosted (type-1/type-2) events require only the "2D cut" for isolation, but resolved (type-3) events require both the 2D cut and tight PF isolation. This is also why the isolation efficiency scalefactor is only applied to type-3 events. I clarified this language for AN v7.
   * Ref. 28: provide paper ID please
      * %GREEN% recommended citation (that I've now also included in AN v7) is [[http://inspirehep.net/record/1260669][this PAS]].
   * Fig. 7: data/MC ratio increases from type-1 to type-3: why?
      * %GREEN% This was due to two things, the first being that those plots did not show any data-driven QCD contributions, which I've added in ANv7. The second was that my type-3 selection was a bit too loose (I've since changed it in AN v7 to require two medium - rather than loose - b-tagged jets). Sent along new plots to confirm.
   * L703-720: isolation SF applied only to type-3 events? loose ID SF applied to all events?
      * %GREEN% Indeed the isolation scalefactor is only applied to type 3 events because type 1 and type 2 events don't have any PF isolation requirements. For all events the medium ID SF is applied. The reference to "loose" here is a holdover/typo from a previous note version, and my language has been fixed and clarified for AN v7. In that version I also binned my plots of isolation better, and added overflow bins to all of my control plots.

      * %GREEN% I added this requirement for AN v7
   * JME POG does not perform a dedicated calibration of AK8 jets. I guess that, given that you perform a kinematic fit while allowing jet momenta to vary in magnitude, you are probably not very sensitive to a potential miscalibration of these jets. Still, have you investigated this in any way or checked with other analyses that had? Alternatively, if JEC uncertainties in the boosted topologies have a small impact on your measurement compared to other systematic uncertainties, you should be safe. If you have impact plots that show the ranking of systematic uncertainties, I'd be curious to see them. Otherwise, I think the scale of AK8 jets needs to be validated or you should check with JERC conveners if the uncertainties for AK8 jets are considered okay.
      * %GREEN% JERC conveners validated that AK8 jet uncertainties are alright. [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/jes/754.html][HN thread about this]]

   * Muon selection: muons |eta| should be < 2.4 as there are no muon detectors beyond 2.4
      * %GREEN% Done, this change will be reflected in the next iteration.
   * For the electrons your trigger intrinsically has isolation requirement. It is generally best to apply offline criteria that are tighter than the online ones, so I have some concerns about this case. Isn't there an alternative electron trigger with higher pt cut but no iso requirement? It would be good to contact the electron and trigger TOP PAG contacts.
      * %GREEN% Changed the electron trigger in the boosted channels to HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165 OR HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT after B2G Z' to boosted ttbar analysis. Anastasia Karavdina has scalefactors for this trigger configuration's efficiency measurement that I can use.
   * you also need to get your privately derived electron scale factors approved.
      * %GREEN% This wasn't the case before, but scalefactors have now been measured for all of the triggers I'm using, so my preliminary private measurement is no longer needed.
   * What corrections are applied in the control plots shown in Sec. 5.8 and 6.4? Generally good agreement for type-3 mu+jets events, but there are significant discrepancies in the other categories.
      * %GREEN% Control plots shown include all corrections listed under "systematics". Bugfixes and changes brought agreement much closer. Note that control plots don't include estimates of QCD background, and that top pT reweighting has a significant effect on the normalization of top MC, especially in boosted channels.
   * Please note that the binning of the scale factors you use should match you selection cuts, i.e. if you require lepton pt > 55 GeV, the corresponding SFs bin should be e.g. [55-60], not e.g. [50-60]. 
      * %GREEN% I double-checked the scalefactor measurements I'm using, and adjusted the boosted lepton pT cut to 50 GeV (from 55 GeV) since the bin edges are reliably at 50 GeV. The resolved channels' lepton pT cut at 30 GeV also reflects bin edges with no problem. I have a simple measurement of the b-tagging efficiency in MC for AK4 jets and I edited the histogram limits in that file to reflect the AK4 jet selection criteria.

   * what's causing the normalization issue in type-1 events?
      * %GREEN% As mentioned above this is now greatly improved in v6; control plots do not show estimates of QCD background, and top pT reweighting as well as various bugfixes have a large effect on MC normalization.
   * what's the timeline to add missing systematics (additional modeling uncertainties, etc.)?
