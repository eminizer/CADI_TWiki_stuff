---+!! Review of TOP-15-018: Measurement of the ttbar AFB at 13Tev in boosted/resolved l+jets

%TOC{title="Contents:"}%

---++ Introduction

This analysis is a template measurement of the top quark forward backward asymmetry and anomalous chromoelectric/chromomagnetic moments in boosted and resolved l+jets events using the full 2016 dataset from CMS and the LHC. Our CADI line is TOP-15-018 ([[cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines?line=TOP-15-018&tp=an&id=1550&ancode=TOP-15-018][link]]), and we have a review hypernews ([[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018.html][link]]).

   * %RED% Table 2: observed p values appear to be too good. For instance for the d and μ fits, all of them are above 50% and most are very close to 1. I think you need to comment on this in the paper, as it clearly looks like your error bars are too big.

   * %RED%  Abstract: The fit results on the three parameters (pars) of interest are presented, this is very nice, but it is not clear if this is a simultaneous fit of the three pars or fitting only one par at the time and setting others to zero. Same for the summary of the paper. I think the important point of fitting only par at a time should be made clear in those places.
   * %RED% Drell Yan variables, you call them first (l.90) c*, xF and mTT and then suddenly in l.312 c*_r, x_r and m_r, are the latter really introduced. I searched for it by eye and couldn't find it.
   * %RED% p.14 you discuss the 4D binned observable vector and that you optimise the binning for the different Channels. In Fig. 7 then one can see the bins, but one has to do guess work how e.g. the 222 bins in the Type 3 mu + jets are related to the 4D space (m_r, x_r, c*_R) and Q. Couldn't you give somewhere (e.g. appendix) some more information on the order of variables in the 222 bins and roughly how many bins for each of the variables are used?

   * %RED% l.455 the smoothing of the templates seems quite important. For the nominal templates you use Barlow Beeston light but for the alternative templates zero stat. Uncertainty right? 
It could be mentioned:
   * %RED% what smoothing algorithm was used, e.g. KDE or Splines often there is some steering parameter related to the effective length of the smoothing
   * %RED% that stat. unc. of the templates after smoothing are neglected in the final fits.
Further question:
   * %RED% is it a 4D smoothing or smoothing of the mapped 1D histogram? If if is the latter: how to deal with inevitable jumps in the 4D distribution mapped to 1D, corresponding to increasing one observable value and and jumping from last to first value of another observable?

   * %RED% l.486 talking here about interpolating shapes within the +-1 sigma interval but what about outside that region, how do you extrapolate?
   * %RED% l.493-498 You don"t say anything about the assumed true values of nuisance pars in the throwing of the toy experiments,  e.g. set to zero or do use the profiled values as function of the pars of interested. The latter is the prescription in the ATLAS+CMS combined note from 2011.

l508-519 GOF-tests. From the CMS Statistics Committee we have some overview of suitable tests at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/StatComGOF On this page there is a link to Bob Cousins's article http://cousins.web.cern.ch/cousins/ongoodness6march2016.pdf In his article he points out difficulties with GOF tests in higher dimensions. 
   * %RED% The test you are doing is in the 4D observable space y, right? So the test would depend on the binning ordering scheme of the four variables, right? 
   * %RED% Why are the p values for d and mu so close to unity, any idea? Wouldn't one expect them to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1?
   * %RED% Maybe a chi2 GOF test would have been also possible based on the -2ln L using the saturated model, as implemented in the combine tool and described on the above twiki.

   * %RED% There is not much said about the outcome of the template fits on the nuisance pars, are there any large pulls observed or not?
   * %RED% Figure 7 what does the MC uncertainty in the plot mean, is this something related to Post-fit uncertainties?

   * %RED% It contains  sentences that at times ignore the "Oxford" comma rule of CMS.
   * %RED% Sentences that begin with acronyms.
   * %RED% Sentences that are far too long and too convoluted to provide clear meaning. In particular, most of Section 7 is abysmal. The descriptions of systematic uncertainties in L400-478 and in the table correspond to some of the worst I have seen at CMS. It is unfortunate that your LE could not help improve this important section.
   * %RED% Authors use many poorly chosen words (one example is using the word "clean" instead of "cleanse") and prepositions.
   * %RED% Improper hyphenation (e.g., using "t-tagged" rather than "t tagged").
   * %RED% Overuse of "considered", when that word is redundant.
   * %RED% General misuse of the terms "leptonic" and "hadronic," where "lepton" and "hadron" (or jets) are meant.
   * %RED% The confusing use of a parallel sentence structure with some items appearing in parentheses.
   * %RED% Confusion of hadrons with jets and with quarks (the top quark decays to "Wb" or to   "q \qbar b" and not hadronically, as these quarks evolve into jets).
   * %RED% Confusing the background from multijet events with the expected background from MC QCD-generated multijet events. It is best to use “QCD multijets” only when meaning the MC events.
   * %RED% You use too many unneeded quotation marks that I have also tried to correct. 
   * %RED% The labels in figures must be consistent even in font with those used for the same objects in the text.
   * %RED% Please note that "varying" is not the same as "changing". You rarely vary parameters, except in fitting. Unless you use a floating change, most of your variations should be called "changes by one standard deviation."
   * %RED% Please avoid words such as "toy", as they demean our work (despite that some of our theorists like them). 
   * %RED% "Data" always refers to the events we find in the detector, and not to the modeling. Avoid the meaningless word “real.”

   * %RED% line 49-51: did we make this check ourselves? If so we could say so
   * %RED% line 105: I get confused on the discussion you have on figure 2.  First: is Dilution the right name for this variable in fig 2d?  D=1 means  no dilution, right? Then there is the discussion on the increasing value  with xF. For xF <0.7 the values are close to one and I assume this is  what you mean with the 'increasing values in the qqbar dominated area. But then there is a drop of D for larger xF values. What is the reason for that? It looks beyond just statistics.
   * %RED% line 170 The ruin-2 vertex selection also include the pTMiss at the vertex as an object. This should be added 
   * %RED% line 180 add a reference to the method used for the mentioned off-set correction
   * %RED% line 190-191 Why do we term this 'key based cleaning'?
   * %RED% line 213: So the electron is not required to be isolated here?
   * %RED% line 217: "as they are halved or doubled: you mean for the systematic uncertainties later? otherwise it is not clear to me what the sentence means...
   * %RED% line 226: do we really use the MLM here? This is normally used on for LO programs while for NLO we use FxFx merging
   * %RED% line 278 For the type-2 we require 4 AK4 jets (as for type-3, see line 281), I assume one from the leptonicaly  decaying top and one from the hadronically decaying one. So it means that all jets from the top decays must be resolved? If not, why do we have the condition of 4 AK4 jets for type-2?
   * %RED% line 299: After this line one should add what the advantage is of using Type-2 at all in this paper. It concerns 10% of the events and we do not use the AK8 feature. I take that this class less background/better efficiency for the kinematic fitting than the type-3? 
   * %RED% line 379-380: "that are less resolved": do you mean broader? But the W+jet should not have a "top quark mass" at all..?
   * %RED% line 383: So is region D the nominal signal selection region. Do we use this methodology to predict the background in region D? 
   * %RED% line 414: "multiple independent methods" This very vague. Can we add a bit more information here on the type of cross check triggers that we used?
   * %RED% line 424 Uncertainties "are retained"... you mean calculated or determined? Otherwise we can just drop 'are retained and' here.
   * %RED% line 448: Do you also use the combinations where one scale is scaled-up by a factor of two and the other is scaled down? It is recommended to exclude these combinations from the systematic error determination, as otherwise it gives a too pessimistic  estimate. 
   * %RED% line 458: very few details are given in this section, on what is exactly used for modelling choices for the colour reconnections, unlike in other papers.If we do the same as done in these papers maybe we should refer to it?
   * %RED% lines 475-478 : these lines sound a bit mysterious and I am not sure I understand what you mean to say here.
   * %RED% line 492: Does it make any difference even if you would have assumed AFB = 0? I guess not.
   * %RED% line 520-522: It is fine if A_FB agrees with these results and calculations but it is far and foremost also very much compatible with zero. So we actually don't really measure anything yet. I found the formulation in this paragraph misleading.
   * %RED% Figure 3: in some of the figures here the data is clearly lower than the prediction and well outside the MC uncertainty. Is this not a worry?

General:
   * %RED% Throughout the paper (including in the Abstract, etc.), as the "AFB" has been introduced at the beginnings of the Abstract (on the 1st line) and the main text (on L23), it can be used afterward to shorten from (e.g. the 11th line of Abstract) "The forward-backward asymmetry measured ..." --> "The AFB measured ..." Other places where the similar changes can be made are L25, L48, L64-65, L78, L111, L113 and L520, etc.
Specific:
   * %RED% L7-8 the "(SM)" may should be moved forward from "In the standard model of particle physics (SM)," --> "In the standard model (SM) of particle physics,"
L18, L106 and L108: As the "CM" has only been used twice in whole paper and it is looked somehow similar as "CMS", it seems not very necessary to introduce it on 
   * %RED% L18, i.e. "in the ttbar center-of-mass (CM)" --> "in the ttbar center-of-mass" then, two places should be modified correspondingly, i.e. 
   * %RED% L106 and L108: (two places) "the CM frame," --> "the center-of-mass frame,"
L27, L228, L238 and L240. I'm not sure whether the article word "the" should be added at the beginning of these sentences, i.e. 
   * %RED% (a) L27: "NLO effects in QCD" --> "The NLO effects in QCD" 
   * %RED% (b) L228: "MC samples used are normalized to ..." --> "The MC samples used are normalized to ..." 
   * %RED% (c) L238, L240 and L243: (three similar places) "“Type-1(or 2 or 3)” events are those ..." --> "The “Type-1(or 2 or 3)” events are those ..."
   
   * %RED% L33, I'm not sure whether a comma is better to be replaced by a semi-colon, i.e. "NLO QCD expectation, however, more recent results [9–11] are ..." --> "NLO QCD expectation; however, more recent results [9–11] are ..."
L41, L48 and L112. As the "LO" has been introduced on L9-10, it can be used to shortened from 
   * %RED% (a) L41: (also, to follow the good example on L107, from the pronunciation point of view, the article word "a" should be changed) "The adopted model is a leading-order ..." --> "The adopted model is an LO ..." 
   * %RED% (b) L48 and L112: (two places) "leading-order" --> "LO"
L66-67, L136, L173, L207, L212-213, L247, L258, L273, L306, L308 and L313. These lines may be shortened from 
   * %RED% (a) L66-67: (as the "d" and "mu" have been introduced on L52-53) "Values of the anomalous chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments have ..." --> "Values of the d and mu have ..."
   * %RED% (b) L136: "to the cross section hypotheses in Eqs. (4), (5), and (6)." --> "to the cross section hypotheses in Eqs.(4)-(6)."
   * %RED% (c) L173: (as the "PF" has been introduced on L155) "of all reconstructed particle-flow objects in an event." --> "of all reconstructed PF objects in an event."
   * %RED% (d) L207: (to follow the good examples on L61, etc.) "in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV," --> "in 2016 at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV,"
   * %RED% (e) L212-213: "single-muon trigger requiring an isolated muon with pT > 24 GeV, or a single-electron trigger requiring an electron with pT > 27 GeV." -->  "single-muon (-electron) trigger requiring an isolated muon (electron) with pT > 24 (27) GeV,"

   * %RED% (g) L258: (to follow the good example on L159, etc.) "according to the scalar sum of the pT" --> "according to the scalar pT sum"
   * %RED% (h) L273: (as the "SD" has been introduced on L194) "jet mass after soft-drop application," --> "jet mass after SD application,"
   * %RED% (i) L306 and L313: (two places on each line) "type-1, type-2, and type-3 ..." --> "type-1, -2, and -3 ..."
   * %RED% (j) L308: "type-1 and type-2 events are further required to have ..." --> "type-1 and -2 events are further required to have ..."
L98-99 and L218-219, L143 and L160-161, L158 and L169. The "PDF", "eta" and "PV" should be explained at their 1st appearances in text on L98, L143 and L158, respectively, instead of L218 and L160 for the "PDF" and "eta", i.e.
   * %RED% (a) L98-99: (also, the "PDF" can be used to shorten L99) "and antiquark parton distribution functions of the proton are much “softer” than the quark parton distribution functions," --> "and antiquark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton are much “softer” than the quark PDFs,"
   * %RED% (b) L143: "calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by ..." --> "calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (eta) coverage provided by ..."
   * %RED% (c) L158: (as the "PV" has been used in Table 1) "at the primary interaction vertex as determined by ..." --> "at the primary vertex (PV) of interaction as determined by ..."
   (d) L218-219, L160-161 and L169: (then can be shortened correspondingly)
      * %RED% (i) L218-219: (also, as the "alphaS" has been introduced on L107, it does not need to be explained again at the end of L218) "on the choice of the parton distribution function (PDF) set NNPDF3.0 [45] with strong coupling alphaS = 0.118 ..." --> "on the choice of the PDF set NNPDF3.0 [45] with alphaS = 0.118 ..."
      * %RED% (ii) L160-161: "Muons are identified in the pseudorapidity range |eta| < 2.4," --> "Muons are identified in the range |eta| < 2.4,"
      * %RED% (iii) L169: "to be the primary pp interaction vertex." --> "to be the PV of pp interaction."

   * %RED% L119, it is looked odd that two words of "large..." are placed almost next each other. It may be improved by changing the 1st one from, e.g. "effects of the anomalous moments are largest at large pair mass." --> "effects of the anomalous moments are most significant at large pair mass." or "effects of the anomalous moments are most noticeable at large pair mass."
   * %RED% L122-123 and L127, it will be much more clear if the "type-1", "-2" and "-3" are introduced explicitly on these three lines, i.e. "the first of the three considered ttbar decay topologies comprises ... products are fully merged into single jets. The second topology...high pT. Finally, the third and most populated category includes ..." --> "the first (type-1) of the three considered ttbar decay topologies comprises ... products are fully merged into single jets. The second topology (type-2)...high pT. Finally, the third (type-3) and most populated category includes ..."
   * %RED% L189-190, I tried hard, but still have not understood the sentence of "each jet has subtracted (“cleaned”) from it the momenta of any leptons within it." well yet. Hopefully, this sentence can be revised to make readers earlier to understand.
L221-223 and L229-231, to be consistent in this paper (e.g. L49, L95, L153-154, L396, Fig.7's caption, L737 and L743, etc.) and with all other CMS papers, (a) a hyphen should be added between "t channel" or between "s channel"; (b) the word of "channel" should be added after the "tW" and "W+jets and Z/gamma+jets", i.e.
      * %RED% L221-223: (three places) "both in the t channel [46] with POWHEG v2 and MADSPIN [47] and in tW with POWHEG v1 [48]. Background ... quark processes in the s channel are simulated using the MC@NLO MC ..." --> "both in the t-channel [46] with POWHEG v2 and MADSPIN [47] and in tW channel with POWHEG v1 [48]. Background ... quark processes in the s-channel are simulated using the MC@NLO MC ..."
      * %RED% L229-231: (four places) "in the s and t channels [53], at NLO plus next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL) for single top quark production in tW [54], at ... (NNLO) for W+jets and Z/gamma+jets [55]," --> "in the s- and t-channels [53], at NLO plus next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL) for single top quark production in tW channel [54], at ... (NNLO) for W+jets and Z/gamma+jets channels [55],"

   * %RED% L226, it seems more clear if some words are swapped and a word of "by" is added, i.e. "matched using the MLM prescription [51] to PYTHIA8 parton showers with tune CUETP8M1." --> "matched to PYTHIA8 parton showers with tune CUETP8M1 by using the MLM prescription [51]."
L228, L238, L240 and L243. I'm not sure whether the article word "The" should be added at the beginning of each sentence on these lines, i.e.
   * %RED% (a) L228: "MC samples used are normalized to ..." --> "The MC samples used are normalized to ..."
   * %RED% (b) L238 and L240: (two places) "“Type-x” events are those ..." --> "The“type-x” events are those ..."
   * %RED% (c) L243: (also, the appearances of two words "events" in the sentence may be avoided by modifying a few words) "“Type-3” events are relatively lower mass events in which the" --> "The “type-3” events have relatively lower masses in which the"

   * %RED% L250-251, (a) the "calorimeter" may should be plural, (b) the reason for the rejection may should be briefly explained, i.e. "any electron candidates in the transition region between barrel and endcap calorimeter, corresponding to ..., are rejected." --> "any electron candidates in the transition region between barrel and endcap calorimeters, corresponding to ..., are rejected because the reconstruction of an electron object in this region is not optimal."
   * %RED% L255, (a) the "DeltaR" may should be defined at its 1st appearance in text here, then the "phi" also should be explained; (b) at the same time, since the "Delta eta**2" (the "Delta phi**2" is the same) may be looked ambiguous as either "Delta((eta)**2)" or "(Delta(eta))**2", in order to be less confusing, please do not forget to add two pairs of bracket in the formula of DeltaR; (c) as the numerical value of the angle phi has been implicitly shown on L257 and L259, etc., and an angle can be measured in either the radians or degrees, therefore, the unit of phi may should be specified, i.e. "and DeltaR with" "and DeltaR (= sqrt((delta phi)**2 + (delta eta)**2), where phi is azimuthal angle in radians) with"
   * %RED% L276, to be consistent in this paper (e.g. L273 and L194, etc.), a hyphen or a space may should be added between "softdrop", i.e. "softdrop mass in the range" --> "soft-drop mass in the range" or "soft drop mass in the range"
   * %RED% L286-288, the expressions of "a b quark jet" and "a b tagging efficiency" are looked quite odd, similar as "a b c d xxxx". It may be improved by following the good examples on L215-216, L243, L272, L276 and L278, etc., i.e. (at three places) "a b quark jet and a 9% probability of misidentifying a light quark jet as a b quark jet (mistag rate). Type-3 events require ... ... working point of the algorithm with a b tagging efficiency of 63% ..." --> "a bottom quark jet and a 9% probability of misidentifying a light quark jet as a bottom quark jet (mistag rate). Type-3 events require ... ... working point of the algorithm with a b-tagging efficiency of 63% ..." or "a b-quark jet and a 9% probability of misidentifying a light quark jet as a b-quark jet (mistag rate). Type-3 events require ... ... working point of the algorithm with a b-tagging efficiency of 63% ..."

Figs.3-5 and 7
   * %RED% (i) at the upper-left corner outside each plot, to be consistent in the text of this paper, two spaces before and after the symbol "+" should be removed, e.g. (in the left column of Fig.7, also to be consistent with Figs.3-5, a hyphen should be added after the "Type") "Type x mu  +  jets (SR)" -->"Type-x mu+jets (SR)" where the "x" is 1 or 2 or 3.
   * %RED% (ii) The captions of Figs.4 and 5 are almost identical as Fig.3 except differing by one type-index on the 2nd line; thus, I'm not sure whether captions of Figs.4 and 5 can be entirely replaced by "Figure 4: The same Data/MC comparison as Fig.3, but for events passing full type-2 selection criteria." and "Figure 5: The same Data/MC comparison as Fig.3, but for events passing full type-3 selection criteria."
Figs.6-7, in the legends and axis labels, the 1st letter of each line should be capital, and the non-leading words should be in the lower case, i.e.
   * %RED% (i) Fig.6's caption: (the 1st and last lines) "toy median values ... ... data fit" --> "Toy median values ... ... Data fit"
   * %RED% (ii) Fig.6's vertical axis labels: "Best Fit ..." --> "Best fit ..."
   * %RED% (iii) Fig.7's horizontal axis labels: "template bin" --> "Template bin"
L319, L323, L372-373, L393, L396, L406-408, L432 and L496. These lines may be shortened from:
   * %RED% (a) L319: "transverse momentum of the measured and simulated events," --> "pT of the measured and simulated events,"
   * %RED% (b) L323: "in Eqs.(4), (5), and (6) for the numerators and" --> "in Eqs.(4)-(6) for the numerators and"
   * %RED% (c) L372-373: (also, it'll be looked and sound better if a comma is added after the 1st clause) "For the type-1 and type-2 regions the amount of W+jets background ..." --> "For the type-1 and -2 regions, the amount of W+jets background ..."
   * %RED% (d) L393: "events in the “B” sidebands to the “A” sidebands," --> "events in the “B” to the “A” sidebands,"
   * %RED% (e) L396: "in the type-1, type-2, and type-3 signal region ..." --> "in the type-1, -2, and -3 signal region ..."
   * %RED% (f) L406-408: (as the "JES" and "JER" have been used only one time on L408 in whole paper, they may not have to be introduced on L406-407, and then be spelled out on L408) "of a jet energy scale (JES) dependent on pileup as well as jet pT, ..., and a smearing of the jet energy resolution (JER) depen-dent on jet |eta|. The JES and JER factors are ..." --> "of a jet energy scale dependent on pileup as well as jet pT, ..., and a smearing of the jet energy resolution depen-dent on jet |eta|. The jet energy scale and resolution factors are ..."
   * %RED% (g) L432: (similar as the item (19a(i)) above, to be consistent in the text of this paper, two spaces before and after the symbol "+" should be removed; also, the 1st letter of this line should be capital in order to be consistent in this Section) "top quark pT reweighting: Recent NNLO QCD  +  electroweak calculations ..." --> "Top quark pT reweighting: Recent NNLO QCD+electroweak calculations ..."
   * %RED% (h) L496: (to be consistent with the tense in this Section, the verb "was" may should be changed) "in the toys whose postfit median was that" -->"in the toys whose postfit median is that"
L412, L418-419, L440 and L471-472.
   * %RED% Those uncertainty related quantities (e.g. 4.6%, 0.94, 0.96, 100 per-event weight, 1% and 10%, etc.) may should cite some reference articles, so that readers would not wonder why these numbers are chosen, why not any other arbitrary numbers.

   * %RED% L426, similar as the item (20g) above, the 1st letter of this line should be capital in order to be consistent in this Section, i.e. "top tagging efficiency:" --> "Top tagging efficiency:"
   * %RED% L430, from the pronunciation point of view, the article word "a" should be changed from "by a MC matching procedure," --> "by an MC matching procedure,"
   * %RED% L465, I'm not sure whether the "B" in the nominator should be explained, but an extra space in the denominator after the "b" should be removed or be replaced by a hyphen, i.e. "xb = pT(B)/pT(b   jet) for" --> "xb = pT(B)/pT(b jet) (where B is ...) for" "xb = pT(B)/pT(b-jet) (where B is ...) for"
Table 1
   * %RED% (a) In the header column, the 9th row above the bottom of Table, similar as the item (20) above, the 1st letter of this row should be capital to be consistent in this Table, i.e. "top pT reweighting" --> "Top pT reweighting"
   * %RED% (b) The location of Table 1 may should be moved backward to be below L495 since the "sigma" used in the 2nd column of this Table has not been explained until L495.

   * %RED% L515, the "p-value" may should be given a Reference article, i.e. "in terms of a “p-value”:" --> "in terms of a “p-value”[xx]:"
   * %RED% Fig.7, in the caption, the last two lines, to be consistent in this paper, a space before the symbol "+" should be removed, i.e. (at four places)"mu  +jets (left column) and e  +jets (right column) channels, and the ... type-3 mu  +jets (third row) and e  +jets (lower row) channels," --> "mu+jets (left column) and e+jets (right column) channels, and the ... type-3 mu+jets (third row) and e+jets (lower row) channels,"
   * %RED% Page 21, Table 2: In the header column, (a) the 1st letter of each row should be capital; (b) an extra space before the symbol "+" should be removed in order to be consistent in this paper; (c) a space should be added after the symbol ">" or "<" at the end of row in order to be consistent in this paper, e.g. (the 1st two rows) "type-1 mu  +jets (Q >0)" --> "Type-1 mu+jets (Q >  0)" 
   * %RED% L669, in [20], to be consistent in this paper and with all other CMS papers, a hyphen should be added in the article title, i.e. "Top production in hadron hadron collisions and" --> "Top production in hadron-hadron collisions and"
   * %RED% L678, in [23], the 2nd word in the article title may should be in the lower case, i.e. "A New method for combining NLO QCD with shower ..." --> "A new method for combining NLO QCD with shower ..." Another one which also needs to be changed by the similar way is [24] for two words of "Parton Shower".
   * %RED% The "year" numbers should be given for Ref.[42]. If there would be problems to display the year number with the default bib file, it may be fixed by changing from "article" to "unpublished" in the bib file.
   * %RED% L737 and L739, in [46], (a) to be consistent in the text of this paper and with all other CMS papers, the font of "s-" and "t-" in the article title should be changed; (b) to be consistent in this Section, the Erratum should be changed, "shower in POWHEG: s(non-italic)- and t(non-italic)-channel contributions”, ... arXiv:0907.4076. [Erratum: JHEP02,011(2010)]." --> "shower in POWHEG: s(italic)- and t(italic)-channel contributions”, ... arXiv:0907.4076. [Erratum: JHEP  02 (2010) 011]."
   * %RED% L799, to be consistent with all other Sections in this paper, the last word "Factors" in the Section title should be in the lower case, i.e. "A Appendix 1: Reweighting Factors" --> "A Appendix 1: Reweighting factors"

Even though structure and overall style of the paper are fine, there is an unusually large number of places where language improvements are needed, and/or where CMS style guidelines are not followed. To give some examples,
   * %RED% Is it sub-process or subprocess?
   * %RED% Wrong hyphenation in many places.
   * %RED% Punctuation (commas) missing, wrong capitalization.
   * %RED% Spacing in some math expressions.
   * %RED% Jargon, such as pre-fit / post-fit and "ID".
   * %RED% Sometimes very convoluted sentences/descriptions, such as the paragraph on L.381-398.
We trust that the authors work with the LE and the publications committee
and improve all Type A issues.

   * %RED% The first paragraph of the paper, L.2-13, may benefit from a couple of references.
   * %RED% The definition of LO and NLO in Fig. 1 caption can be removed, it is already in the text.
   * %RED% The trigger efficiencies given in L.152-154 might better be moved to the end of paragraph around L.213, where trigger conditions are discussed. Also, a comment on the comparatively low efficiency in the resolved electron channel might be added.
   * %RED% L.202, "The subjects... are returned as individual objects": I guess what is meant is "retained" or "considered", rather than "returned"?
   * %RED% L.246, "mutually exclusive", along with L.269-281: From the text it is not clear how type-3 is made mutually exclusive with respect to the other two types of events. There must be some veto that is not mentioned in the text (or we missed it).
   * %RED% L.265, "Events... require": please rephrase, the events do not require anything.
   * %RED% L. 301, "... or neither, with b-tagged jets in place." Very hard to understand what this is supposed to mean.
   * %RED% Figure captions 3-5: The captions mention the "pre-fit predictions", and in the flow of the paper they are right after the description of the "kinematic fitting" (L.305). Since one has nothing to do with the other, presumably, this should be rephrased and/or made clearer.
   * %RED% L.381-398: This paragraph includes a very convoluted description of the method and could benefit from simplification. Region D seems not to be defined. Also, the role of the W+jets control regions (L.397) is unclear.
   * %RED% L.402, "as described in Section 8": Seems to be towards the end of Section 7, rather than Section 8.
   * %RED% L.420, 424: How are uncertainties "retained"?
   * %RED% L.445-446: What are "Modeling uncertainties in the matrix element generation process", and which "event shape distributions" is the text refering to?
   * %RED% L.458-467: The uncertainties on color reconnection and b fragmentation need references.
   * %RED% L.473-374: Why is there a +-10% uncertainty added for the W+jets cross section, while the corresponding background contribution has been determined from a data control region?
   * %RED% L.475, "statistical uncertainty": really only "statistical", isn't this supposed to cover the entire uncertainty on QCD background?
   * %RED% Table 1, the column heading "Scale" seems somewhat unusual and easy to misinterpret. Maybe better "Average size"?
   * %RED% Table 2: The p-values for the measurements of d and mu in the 12 (!) different regions are mostly very close to 1. This must be explained in the paper, because from the present description it is unclear how such an unphysical result could happen.
   * %RED% L.534-537 is very convoluted and should be simplified or split in two sentences.

   * %RED% Given that this is mainly a search for BSM effects, it seems difficult to justify not including 2017+2018 data to a referee. The A_fb appears to be completely statistics limited, and for the other parameters the statistical errors are similar to the systematics. So the additional data should give improved sensitivity to deviations from the SM.
   * %RED% Title: It would be more effective if it could be shortened and more to the point. For example: "Forward-backward asymmetry in top quark events in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV"
   * %RED% abstract, last sentence: "The forward-backward ...comparable...measurements." It is not clear what you are referring to. Presumably the comparison is to the d and mu values. Why not just say that? It could be replaced by: "Results on d and mu are comparable to those obtained at the Tevatron." In general, comparison to Tevatron results is not straightforward. It would be better to remove the sentence from the abstract. It would fit better in the conclusions.
   * %RED% L16: It would be good to clarify earlier what is the final state used for the study.
   * %RED% LL20-21: it would be good to add a sketch
   * %RED% L22: There is also a 13 TeV paper submitted (http://inspirehep.net/record/1742786?ln=en), that should presumably be cited here. Unfortunately it seems nearly impossible to compare to those previous CMS results, since they use a different notation (+ different theory formalism?), and quote 95% CL limits instead of a central value with 1-sigma errors. It would have been extremely helpful to present the results in a way that could be directly compared. If that's not possible, at least some statement explaining how the sensitivity of this result compares to previous limits on the chromo-E/M moments seems mandatory.
   * %RED% L22: odd and even distributions: not clear what that means in this context. Please clarify.
   * %RED% L27: NLO ...expected to produced ... positive values for AFB. How is this relevant? "small" should be quantified. AFB is expected to be symmetric at 13 TeV. The quark-related interactions are a small fraction at LO, and even smaller at NLO.
   * %RED% L37: A_C is a different measurement. It is not clear why A_C "uses only a fraction of the available information". Please clarify.
   * %RED% L38: done-> performed
   * %RED% LL38-40: rather than "model-independent" and "simplified model", it would be better to mention that here the goal is to model the different qq, qg, and gg contributions with the goal of isolating the different components.
   * %RED% LL45-51: The formulation is hard to follow. Is this necessary? It would be better to describe the measurement from the point of view of the observables.
   * %RED% Eq.3: many terms are not defined. Is this really needed?
   * %RED% L59: why the subscript 1? The observable is defined in Eq. 1.
   * %RED% L67: how does this measurement compare to those in Ref.22, in terms of accuracy? Please clarify it in the Summary.
   * %RED% L78: more challenging -> less sensitive ?
   * %RED% L85: what are the "Drell-Yan variables"? why not just "the following variables... "? Please clarify.
   * %RED% LL90-91: In Fig.2 there are 4 distributions. Please add description of all 4.
   * %RED% L92: It is not clear the logic. "smaller" it certainly is, but it would be good to quantify. The combination of qg and gg is probably because there is little (or no) added sensitivity to the measurement. Yet, the asymmetry in qg may still provide some information. Suggest to either simply state that the qg and gg are combined as they provide negligible sensitivity or to quantify what is "small".
   * %RED% L98: May want to clarify the reason. At LHC, g and qbar come from the sea and are softer.
   * %RED% L99: Please remove "much".
   * %RED% L105: what is "CM frame"? please clarify.
   * %RED% Fig.2: are the distributions normalized to unity? if so, please state it.
   * %RED% Also, distribution in lower right panel: please describe the variable and define it in the text and in the caption.
   * %RED% Eq.4 and Eq.5: What is the relation between the two? Are they both really needed? Eq.4 is at NLO and Eq.5 includes the anomalous parameters. However, from Eq.5 one does not get Eq.4 after setting d=mu=0. It is not clear.
   * %RED% L116: not straightforward that "large beta" means "large pair mass". Also, what is "pair mass"? Please clarify.
   * %RED% general: Eq4/5 is qq and Eq6 is gg. It is missing the contribution of qg. Why?
   * %RED% L120: "dipole moments". Are you referring to d and mu? it would be good to clarify earlier these are dipole moments.
   * %RED% L122: "the first of the three". What is that? Not clear. Better to replace with something like: Three ttbar decay topologies are considered. The first uses two "fat" jets, in which the decay products of the top or tbar are merged in single jets.
   * %RED% L123: "second topology". Later it is referred to type-2. Please specify it here as well. The same applies to the all 3 topologies.
   * %RED% L154: at this point one would expect to know which triggers have been used. However, they only appear at L208. It would be good to move that here.
   * %RED% L154 and Table 1: So the boosted e+jets trigger efficiency is much higher than the resolved e+jets, but the systematic error on the boosted trigger is ~7x larger than on the resolved? Given that the boosted e+jets trigger is by far the largest systematic effect in the table, it would be nice to add some comment on what is driving this. 
   * %RED% L194: Not needed to use both "modified mass drop tagger" and "soft drop". Use only one name for the algorithm.
   * %RED% LL195-196: the names "angular exponent", "soft cutoff", "characteristic radius" do not mean much to the reader. It would be preferable to write what these values represent without having to read the Ref.
   * %RED% L199: bosonic -> W/Z boson
   * %RED% L209: Trigger: single muon pT>50 GeV, single ele pT>115GeV. These are non-isolated leptons. The efficiency for ttbar events for these triggers depends on the boost of the tops. How is this accounted for?
   * %RED% LL236-238: It is not clear whether only one leg or both legs are considered separately. Please clarify.
   * %RED% L239: "decaying with very high momentum" is confusing. What is high is the momentum of the initial top such that the decay products are boosted. Please rephrase.
   * %RED% L241: "either a partially- or fully-merged..." is not clear. "partially-merged"? What is a partially or fully merged hadronic top decay? Are you referring to "top hadronic decay products"? Is it partially- or fully-merged?
   * %RED% Also, if it is fully-merged, it does not fit into the other type-1 category?
   * %RED% L243: "lower mass events": this is jargon. What does it mean? does it refer to m_ttbar? It is not clear.
   * %RED% L248: muon/ele candidates have pT>50/80 GeV for boosted events. Are these values compatible with the triggers at L209? What are the efficiencies?
   * %RED% L272: it would be useful to clarify what is the top-tagging efficiency in the kinematic regions relevant to this analysis.
   * %RED% L291: Are the Refs needed? they are specific for what?
   * %RED% L309: "leptonic top quark mass" is jargon. Are you referring to the leptonic leg? It may be good to define "leptonic/hadronic leg" or "leptonic/hadronic branch" earlier and then use it consistently.
   * %RED% L310: form -> define
   * %RED% L310: constraining -> used to constrain
   * %RED% L312: what is c^star_tau? it was not defined. Please clarify.
   * %RED% L312: what is a Drell-Yan variable? Please clarify (this comment also applies to other similar instances).
   * %RED% L317: the sign of the lepton -> the sign of the lepton charge
   * %RED% Figs. 3-5: It would be helpful to also show an example of how the ttbar shapes look for a non-SM scenario, for some choice of d/mu parameters close to your sensitivity.
   * %RED% Fig.3/4/5, caption: what is "full" in this context? please clarify or remove.
   * %RED% Fig.3/4/5: the last bin includes the overflows? please clarify in the caption.
   * %RED% Fig.4, Type2: middle (x_f): there is a disagreement and the ratio shows a slope. It is strange that this does not appear for the electrons. How is this understood? It would be good to add a sentence in the text addressing this.
   * %RED% Fig.5, Type3: x_f, the slope now appears for both electrons and muons. What is the dependence of x_f on the jet p_T?
   * %RED% L325: It would be good to check if there are recent studies from the TRK or MUO POGs that could be cited to support this, instead of just saying the efficiency symmetry is assumed.
   * %RED% L383: ABCD: The discussion is confusing as it is. Also, as it is, there is no much point in giving the specifics of the A, B, C regions. It would be good to add a sketch to explain this, and better define the regions in isolation and ptmiss. It would help.
   * %RED% L496 and Fig. 6: It seems for d, the Best fit value is degenerate for True values between about -0.01 and 0.01. If this is true, could you add an explaination of how the True value is determined to be 0.002 for a Best fit value of 0?
   * %RED% Fig. 6: It's not clear what is going on with the 2-sigma band around true mu=-0.04, where it becomes very wide vertically.
   * %RED% Table 2: The many p-values of 1.000 for d and mu seem suspicious - can you add some comment to the text on how you interpret this?
   * %RED% L488-492: How much does the assumption of fixing the other 2 parameters to 0/the MC values matter? Would larger values of mu be allowed if d was allowed to vary simultaneously, for example? If so, it should somehow be made more clear in the Results/Summary section that the results are valid for that particular assumption on the other parameters.
   * %RED% L522: This sentence sounds like it's making excuses for not generating more MC. Please consider rephrasing, or even removing it, if it's not one of the main points that readers should take away from the paper.
   * %RED% L531: in the summary only two categories appear, as "resolved" and "boosted", whereas the paper always refers to 3 categories. Please make it consistent.
   * %RED% L536: Please add a comparison to results in earlier measurements. For example: those in [22] or in the ATLAS+CMS combined results JHEP 04(2018)033.

   * %RED% line 189 This phrase sounds a bit convoluted, maybe would be better to rephrase it to something along this:“each jet has subtracted (“cleaned”) from it the momenta of any leptons within it.” -> “leptons reconstructed and identified within jets are not taken into account in the jet momentum computation. This procedure is called “cleaning”.”

From Dick Loveless:
   * %RED% Abstract, lines 11-13:  Does this measurement agree with Tevatron measurements? Line 520 says it agrees, so the sentence should read "This forward-backward asymmetry measurement agrees with Tevatron experiments.".
   * %RED% line 47:  Why is it necessary to set "A_FB" to "A_FB^1"?  In line 25 why not define "A_FB" as the linearized forward-backward asymmetry", change Eq. (2) to "A_FB" and delete the sentence on line 47?  In lines 50 and 59 "A_FB^1" appears again so obviously I (and the reader) are missing some important clarification.
   * %RED% line 60:  What is a "template description of the total cross section"?  Is this a theoretical distribution of the expected cross section as a function of A_FB, d, and mu?  How about writing "The analysis matches a theoretical description of the total cross section as a function of A_FB, d, and mu with a sample of ttbar-enriched events . . .".
   * %RED% line 64:  What are the "three distinct topologies"?  Is it important to explain this in the Introduction?  It is covered in lines 120-129.  I suggest you simply drop "with three distinct topologies" in the introduction.
   * %RED% line 388:  What is "non-QCD MC contamination?
   * %RED% line 404:  This is the location to add the phrase removed from line 217.
From Camilla Galloni:
   * %RED% line 3-4: “The top  quark’s Yukawa coupling to the Higgs potential is close to unity” can you insert a reference?  line 87 : “ longitudinal momentum pL “ by longitudinal do you mean parallel to the beam pipe? Not clear to me also from what is written in line 99-102. Could you improve a bit the description since is one of the main ingredients of the analysis?
   * %RED% line 165: is it possible to put a reference for “zero-suppression”? I’m not sure how much that is jargon. 
   * %RED% line 278: No tau21= tau2/tau1 is applied to select Type 2 events? It should increase the purity of events in which an hadronic decaying W boson originates a large con jet. 
   * %RED% line 299:  in line 240  it’s stated that ““Type-2” events are those for which the  presence of a large, high-momentum, high-mass jet indicates either a partially- or fully-merged hadronic top quark decay”. Instead from line 299  it would seem that you ignore AK8 jets for the hadronic top reconstruction for Type 2 events “Type-2 and type-3 events ignore AK8 jets entirely in their reconstruction, and instead assign each of the four or five AK4 jets with the highest pT either to the leptonic or hadronic side of the decay, or neither, with b-tagged jets in place.”. Please clarify.
   * %RED% line 502: Can an explanation about the 1 and 2 sigma lines irregularities for  the d and mu plots be added? The toy median functions are much more monotone than the 1 and 2 sigma bands.

   * What do you mean by "linearized"? I suppose that AFB(1) refers to some 1st-degree truncation in some sort of polynomial expansion, but in what is the expansion performed?
      * %ORANGE% Morris can answer this question in greater detail than myself, but in the analysis note the model is explained as "a linear forward-backward asymmetry (such as could be caused by several kinds of new physics that interfere with or augment the tree-level process)" (lines 56-58 in the AN) and the two papers cited are linked at [[https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.81.114004][1]] and [[https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.83.114027][2]]. Several models are presented in these papers that could extend the standard model top pair cross section, and their effects are considered in several different ways including effective field theories or effective couplings. Across the board, however, the extensions end up as some functions of the same cos(theta) we present in our paper (sometimes more clearly than others). I do not know how the exact extension we use to parameterize the asymmetric portion of the cross section (eq. 2 in the paper draft, eq. 8 in the AN) was decided on because I'm not sure of the exact correspondence of some numerical factors, but it bears a likeness to the terms in the extended cross section formulae that are dependent on cos(theta) to first order only. I think this is the best answer I can give you at the moment, but hopefully when Morris gets back from vacation he can help me understand better and we can get back to you again.

   * I think that POWHEG v1, not v2, was used for the tW sample (and only for it; v2 for all the rest), for reasons that I used to know. But I may be wrong, so please check.
      * %GREEN% You're correct about this; it totally slipped my mind. I'll make a note of this and change it in the next draft of the paper and the analysis note. Thank you for your detailed eye and I apologize for my error.

   * Figure 7: I understand that when you say "MC uncertainties" you mean the systematic uncertainties that affect the shape of the MC distributions, right? (I am asking because in the usual jargon we use that term for the statistical uncertainty due to the finite size of the MC sample.) When you say "are fully correlated statistical+systematic", what do you mean? Fully correlated between what?
      * %ORANGE% By "MC uncertainties" I am referring to the hashed grey error bars on the stacked MC template histograms in the plots; they are the total combined, post-fit, statistical+systematic uncertainties determined by fits through the combine tool, which is what I was trying to get at by saying "statistical+systematic", and by "fully correlated" I meant that the results are shown with a full treatment of the correlations of the systematic nuisance parameters across the appropriate channels as described in Section 6 of the paper (Section 9 of the AN) as well as with one another. I was trying to say "The hashed grey error bars show the total post-fit template uncertainties in each bin due to statistical as well as systematic uncertainties," but I don't like my language here either. Is there a better way to get the point across that the error bars are post-fit, not pre-fit, and that they show the total uncertainty, not just the statistical uncertainty (like what's shown in the control plots in figs. 3-5 in the paper draft)?

General comments: 

   * The first 5 pages describe the observables of the search/measurement. I  think in some places, in particular the first two pages it could be  better organized. I wonder if we can omit some of the equations... like  Eq. 6 and 7.  I assume these are taken from Ref. 16 and if the reader wants can check them. I find he theory introduction longer also taking into account the length of the experimental part of the discussion given in the paper.
      * %ORANGE% I've spoken to Morris about reorganizing this information better but he is not sure the best way to pare down the discussion and has suggested that we wait for other feedback or more explicit suggestions? We're worried about losing equations 6 and 7 for sake of clarity....

   * Throughout the paper you need to iron out the usage of jargon  expressions like "muon events", "boosted events", "dileptonic ttBar events", "semileptonic tt","templating", ... If you want to use these in the paper you need to first define at the first use case.
      * %GREEN% I've gone line-by-line through the paper and removed a lot of unnecessary jargon. Anything that I do use is defined at first use now.

   * Please add discussion on the trigger selection efficiency in each category and on how it is measured. In lines that follow 385, you state the kinematic dependent SFs are applied... But I think for such an analysis it is important to state how large are those SFs and how they change across the observables that are fitted, and overall what are the trigger efficiencies we have.
      * %GREEN% There are more details about all of this in the AN, but I tried to incorporate some key numbers in the paper draft as well. Added details on average trigger efficiency to end of "Detector" section: "The average selection efficiencies of the triggers applied to data are approximately 95\% (97\%) in the boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets channels and approximately 98\% (74\%) in the boosted (resolved) electron+jets channels." Also added details about trigger SF measurements to section on systematics: "The average values of the scalefactors applied are about 0.94 (0.96) for boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets events and about 0.98 for boosted and resolved electron+jets events. The $\mu$+jets scalefactors were measured by the Muon Physics Object Group \cite{muon_eff_twiki}. The boosted electron+jets scalefactors were measured by the Top Physics Analysis Group \cite{electron_trigger_eff_twiki} and the resolved electron+jets scalefactors were measured by analysts in the Beyond the Second Generation subgroup \cite{andrey_electron_trigger_sfs}."

   * A general comment for section 8: It would be interesting to give some quantitative range for each uncertainty source. Either the input uncertainties or the range of the systematic effect in the templates... You may also consider adding a new column in table 1. You can see how it is done in other analyses such as TOP-18-009 syst. table in the paper draft.
      * %GREEN% I added another column to the table in Section 6 of v2 of the paper and Section 9 of v9 of the analysis note to illustrate this. The column lists for each systematic the mean of the absolute values of the percent content changes observed in each affected process's template bins, quantifying the scale of each uncertainty effect.

   * Also to my taste the length of how the templates are constructed for each background source is not detailed enough. For QCD templates you derive several transfer factors. But you do not discuss their size and dependence on the template shapes. I suggest to extend on this with a  few sentences. 
      * %GREEN% The isolation and MET cuts used to define the QCD estimate sidebands are not correlated with the template observables nor with each other. To quantify the transfer factors I added at the end of the sentence describing them in  the "Background Estimation" section: "The transfer factors are applied to each of the events in the shape sidebands to renormalize the templates to the expected numbers of events in the full signal regions; their values are approximately 0.004 (0.46), 0.003 (0.35), and 0.37 (1.44) in the type-1, type-2, and type-3 signal region $\mu$(electron)+jets channels respectively."

   * Also, it is not clear if W+jets background normalizations  in Q=+ and - are independently let varied or their normalization is constrained by one nuisance.  This is important given that W+ and W- production are not symmetric.
      * %GREEN% In our current treatment there is only one scalefactor, correlated across both charges. I wanted the associated nuisance parameter to basically correct/constrain the overal W+Jets cross section measurement, so I didn't make it charge-dependent (this is also the case for Rbck scaling the other ttbar, single top, and DY+Jets background processes).

   * The results section needs to focus on more the description of the  results  rather than the technical details of the fit. So technical  details are necessary but as it is the section needs further elaboration  on the results putting them into the context of bigger picture, commenting on improvements in this analysis, telling about perspectives  of improving if possible in the future etc...
      * %GREEN% This whole section has been overhauled now.


Detailed comments:

   * L8 "top production" --> does not sound good. you can rearrange the sentence to avoid using it. And example... ".. particle physics, at the LHC top quarks are dominantly produced in pairs via the strong interaction as described by Quantum..."
      * %GREEN% Changed sentence to "In the Standard Model of particle physics, top quarks are dominantly produced in pairs at the LHC via the strong interaction as described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)."

   * L11-12: I think here you can give the proportion of the contribution from these processes (gg, qq...) to the final state.
      * %GREEN% Added "NLO QCD calculations predict approximately 6\% \qqbar, 69\% \glu, and 25\% \qg production of top pairs."

   * L14: needs a reference.
      * %GREEN% Added reference as requested.

   * Figure 2: I might have asked this before, but the bottom right plot includes also gg initial states ? Probably not because otherwise it would be much smaller given that qqbar initial state constitutes only ~10% of the total x-section. If this figure shows only the qqBar initial state cases then it should be clarified otherwise it is misleading. Additionally, these figures use Gen-level top kinematics right ? If yes, please also clarify that.
      * %GREEN% You are correct on both points: the bottom right plot does not include gg initial states, and they all use gen-level top kinematics. This is now stated in the caption.

   * Figure 2 caption: suggest to remove the last sentence it repeats what is written in the text above.
      * %GREEN% done.

   * Figure 2: Please also improve the quality of the bottom-right figure.
      * %GREEN% New CMS style version of this plot availabe in paper v2/note v9.

   * Figure 2: M--> m, also in the text. I also suggest to change it to m(ttBar)  or m_{ttBar}
      * %GREEN% Changed "M" to "m_{ttbar}" everywhere in the paper

   * L64-65 "..beyond the Standard Model processes" --> "Beyond the SM processes"
      * %GREEN% done.

   * L88: suggest not to use i, j as j is used in equation 3 for various background processes I assume. Please make the definition of j explicit too.
      * %GREEN% Changed flavor indices to a,b instead of i,j. Which definition of "j" is unclear?

   * Eq.4. Please explain this equation (and motivation for anti-symmetrisation) by connecting to Eq. 2. I assume this is related to the two parts of the x-section one having only c^2 and the other c  factors ? Just for curiosity and sanity check have you shown the distributions of y where the symmetric and antisymmetric parts sum to the original template ?
      * %GREEN% Indeed, it's the ratio of the c^2 to c portions of the cross sections; added a quick explanation of this. I have not shown that the decomposition sums to the original prediction; I'm not sure if we'd even expect that based on the generated MC? Maybe we can follow up on this in a setting where we can talk in more detail?

   * Eq.6,  c^* at the denominator
      * %GREEN% fixed.

   * - "lepton+jets final states" --> This is rather jargon. Please define it at the first use case.
      * %GREEN% first use found on line 75; changed "...from lepton+jets final states, in which..." to "...from final states containing a single lepton and several hadronic jets, called \"lepton+jets," in which..."
  
   * L 120-129: This is a good place to state what is new (other than new  data) in this analysis wrt. earlier LHC publications. Please point to  the unique features of this measurement wrt the older ones.  You may also bring the references & description of the earlier LHC measurements from lines 38-39 to here.
      * %GREEN% Added "The measurement of the \qqbar initial state top forward-backward asymmetry is the first of its kind at the LHC and can be directly compared with results from the Tevatron experiments \cite{Aaltonen:2011kc,Abazov:2007ab,Abazov:2014cca,Aaltonen:2016bqv,Aaltonen:2017efp}.  Measurements of the anomalous chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments have previously been extracted from measurements of the \ttbar spin correlations \cite{CMS:2014bea, Khachatryan:2016xws}.  This is the first measurement that relies on the \ttbar differential distributions." to the end of this paragraph.

   * L128-129: the second and third typologies are not well motivated. At this point the reader wonders why one should bother with semi- and fully- resolved tops.
      * %GREEN% Agreed, this was worded kind of funny. Changed "...are one such topology.  A second topology considers events of lower pair mass in which the decay products are partly merged.  Finally, the third category includes the lowest mass events that are fully resolved" to "...are one such topology.  A second topology considers events of lower pair mass in which the decay products are partly merged, bridging the gap between events identifiable as either fully merged or fully resolved.  Finally, the third and most populated category includes the lowest mass events that are fully resolved." This at least explains the roles of the other two selections?

   * L147: Suggest to remove the photon measurement description. It is not used in the analysis.
      * %GREEN% Done; removed "The energy of each photon is obtained from the ECAL measurement."

   * L157: repeats L148 for electron measurement
      * %GREEN% Removed "The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker."

   * L162: "Muons are identified"
      * %GREEN% "measured" --> "identified"

   * L157-148: the information given here is not well structured... I am not sure lepton momentum resolution is a critical information for this  measurement. You give trigger efficiency for muons (before you define the trigger system & triggers used in the analysis) but not for electrons...  reco+id efficiency is given only for muons and not for electrons.
      * %GREEN% Removed lepton momentum resolution information. Moved "Muons are identified in the pseudorapidity range $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers." to the paragraph above about PF. Trigger efficiencies are not given in the last paragraph of this section for both muons & electrons ("The average selection efficiencies of the triggers applied to data are approximately 95\% (97\%) in the boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets channels and approximately 98\% (74\%) in the boosted (resolved) electron+jets channels.")
   
   * L173-174: pT_miss used in the PV selection and the ETmiss that is used in the event are not the same. One is explicitly using only tracks that  originate from a particular PV while the other is using PF objects that include neutrals as well.
      * %GREEN% Changed "The energy associated with this \ptvecmiss, called missing transverse energy or \MET," to "The energy of the negative vector sum of all PF objects, called missing transverse energy or \MET,"

   * L190: not clear what you mean with “of any muons whose singular PF candidates it shares”
      * %GREEN% Changed "...each jet has subtracted (``cleaned") from it the momenta of any electrons spatially within it and of any muons whose singular PF candidates it shares." to "...each jet has subtracted (``cleaned") from it the momenta of any leptons within it. Muons are cleaned from jets using key-based cleaning, wherein a muon's fourvector is subtracted from that of a reconstructed jet if the muon's PF candidate appears in the list of jet PF candidates, and electrons are cleaned from jets by subtracting their fourvectors from those of any reconstructed jets within spatial separation $\DR$ less than jet radius."
   
   * L202-207: suggest to move to the end of section 2 lines around 144.
      * %GREEN% This paragraph now comes right before the paragraph about PF stuff

   * L250: "Lepton candidates in the boosted (resolved) regions are required to have pT > 50(30)GeV" 50 GeV is not enough to get events beyond the  turn-on curve of the lepton trigger efficiency in particular for electrons in boosted regimes. The trigger thresholds given in lines are 50 GeV, and for electrons in particular is the case only in the presence of a high pT jet.
      * %GREEN% Bumped this cut up to 80 GeV to synchronize with trigger efficiency measurement for AN v9/paper v2

   * L253: Suggest to include a sentence  for to what "isolation" refers and why it is needed. Start with defining/justifying it for resolved  scenario then say it is modified for boosted scenario.
      * %GREEN% Added the sentence "To ensure that leptons observed in an event correspond to particles in the final decay state rather than products of hadronization, leptons are required to be isolated from nearby hadronic activity in the event." I don't want to switch around the order in which I talk about the algorithms, though, because resolved events are required to pass the 2D cut as well.

   * L258: remove "and" in "photon and..."
      * %GREEN% Done

   * L261: "any event containing" remove S
      * %GREEN% Done (also "are" --> "is")

   * L262 "dileptonic tt decays" is also jargon
      * %GREEN% Changed "...from dileptonic \ttbar decays" to "...from \ttbar decays in which both tops decay to final state leptons"

   * L264: "muon (electron) events" --> "Events with a muon(electron)..."
      * %GREEN% Done

   * Figures 3-5: need to fix the caption. "Transverse momentum (left) and pseudorapidity (right) of lepton (top) and..."  right --> middle and you  need to add Nbjet.  
      * %GREEN% Done

   * Figures 3-5: Also please remove ttBar-hadronic as it contributes super negligible and its color is indistinguishable from ttBar-dileptonic... I assume you do not use separate templates for these two. You can call it "ttBar other" in the leggend and use that label in the text to define in lines 340.
      * %GREEN% Done, this will be reflected in the next drafts (it affects a lot of plots)

   * L291: I think the reader wonders at this point about the underestimated normalization of the Type-I and Type-II events. I think we need to write a few sentence here giving reference to top_pT modelling issue.
      * %GREEN% These plots look different with the new top pT reweighting scheme; the normalization prediction is much better in the new plots in paper v2/note v9.

   * L304-320: I am not sure if the details of the Kinematic fit is  necessary, in particular the formulas showing chi2 minimization etc... Can you not give a reference and just explain in words the procedure in somewhat shorter way ? Most important here in my opinion is the performance, efficiency/purity that is given in lines  326-328.
      * %GREEN% I pared this down a lot for paper v2. I got rid of the equations and a lot of the unnecessary detail, added some references to CMS work with kinematic fitting, and focused on the performance of the method.

   * L344: "well-estimated contributions" --> not clear to what this refers ? a data control region validation ? good MC statistics ?
      * %GREEN% I removed "and well-estimated". My original point was simply that they don't suffer from the MC statistics issues that the QCD background does, nor the cross section uncertainty coupled with rather dominating contribution of the W+Jets process. "Small" handles that fine I think.

   * L341: Drell-Yan Z/g+jets, I guess you want to put a * on gamma.
      * %GREEN% yep, done!

   * L343: "The top and Z/g+jets..."  --> "The sing-letop and..." ?
      * %GREEN% Clarified my language around this.

   * L347: "less precisely estimated from MC" --> due to statistics or other reasons? Please clarify in the paper.
      * %GREEN% Changed to "because its production cross section is less precisely known from theory"

   * L352: Why not to include the M_t,lep^reco in the paper ? I think this would be a nice plot to show... I assume Figure 6 shows it only for signal ttBar events.  So M_t,lep^reco would be a complementary figure showing the background composition distributed over this observable. I think such a plot in all three categories normalized to total luminosity would be very interesting.
      * %GREEN% Replaced the plots of the btagging multiplicity in figs. 3-5 with M_t,lep^reco instead in v2 of the paper.
   
   * L356: "The QCD multijet background contribution is not well estimated in MC due to its large production cross section but low selection  efficiency,"  --> I suggest to call it low stat in MC. Because otherwise the large x-section&low selection efficiency seems to be the physics reason which is not the case.
      * %GREEN% Changed "...due to its large production cross section but low selection efficiency" to "...due to low statistics"

   * Discuss motivation for modified Lorentzian used in kinematic fit in greater detail in AN
      * %GREEN% Added more clarifying language and a reference to the paper we used to find this. It's a relativistc Breit-Wigner form representing two-body t -> Wb decays where the W resonance is correlated to the top threshold.

   * Discuss separation of MC events by production mechanism using MC truth info in greater detail in AN
      * %GREEN% Added the following subsection (called "Production Mechanism Separation") at the start of "Event Selection" in the AN: "As described in Section~\ref{sec:introduction} above, $t\bar{t}$ signal MC samples are separated not only by the nature of their decay but also by the mechanism of their production. We separate MC events into $q\bar{q}$ and $gg/qg$ categories based on MC truth information about the initial partons in the decay. We choose as the initial partons the two ``hard particles" in MC truth whose daughters are the top quark pair. Events are categorized as $gg$ when both partons have ID 21 (corresponding to gluons); $q\bar{q}$ events are those for which both parton IDs are less than 6 (corresponding to non-top quarks) and sum to zero (indicating opposite charge but matching flavor), and $qg$ events are those with exactly one parton whose ID is 21."

   * Perform a cross-check of data-driven QCD background estimation using QCD MC
      * %GREEN% This is done, please see [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/15.html][this thread on the HN]] for more details and plots.
   
   * Run with/without "Rqqbar" nuisance parameter and quantify deviation from generator value and impact on PoIs
      * %GREEN% Impact plots will be available in next version of documentation, but looking at them right now the Rqqbar nuisance gets pulled about 0.5 sigma (which means 0.5%) from its nominal value, with no constraint on its postfit uncertainty, and the impact of this nuisance on PoIs is negligible (<0.0005 for AFB).

   * Mising parton shower (ISR/FSR/hdamp), underlying event (tune), and color reconnection systematics
      * %GREEN% I've added these.

   * Results for NNLO top pT spectra could be used to derive a theory-based top pT reweighting scheme
      * %GREEN% I've done this (and it looks great!). Additional details in [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/13.html][this HN thread]].
      
   * Nuisance for pileup systematics seems to constrain a bit tightly: why might that be?
      * %GREEN% According to Andrea Marini from Higgs Combine this is to be expected because the pileup uncertainty is conservative. It is common to observe.

   * Comments from Nick on Paper draft v0
      * Eqn 12: I assume that you do not run into any issues with -ve yields here? Are the yields in the regions A, B and C sufficient to avoid that?
         * %GREEN% Correct, we don’t have issues with negative yields because the yields in the A, B, and C regions are indeed sufficient. I tuned the MET cuts in each channel partially to solve this problem!
      * In Section 6 you could probably mention the constraints on these nuisance parameters - eg are they assumed to be log-normal / Gaussian etc ...? It could be added to Table 1 
         * %GREEN% I mention the nuisance constraints briefly in Section 7 (lines 435-438), but I can definitely add them to the Table as well.
      * Fig 9 is very nice - I don't often see this in so much detail however, I am confused perhaps about 1 thing. Are you using here directly the measured value of the parameter as the "test-statistic" ? Often the neyman construction involves using the likelihood outcomes to order the results (actually this is more the Feldman-cousins way). Maybe I am misreading those plots.
         * %GREEN% I gave a presentation in a StatComm meeting about this ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762830/contributions/3170892/attachments/1730085/2795956/statcomm_10_8_2018_neyman_and_gof.pdf][link]]) that has more details than I can include here.
   * From statistics questionnaire: after unblinding I will need to return with something about Goodness of Fit.
      * %GREEN% I've run Goodness of Fit tests using the KS algorithm per-channel. Version 9 of the AN explains and lists those results with plots and in a table of p-values. I presented these results before my datacard greenlight at a Higgs Combine meeting on April 17th ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/788727/contributions/3401374/attachments/1831680/2999825/higgs_combine_4_17_2019_fitting_details.pdf][slides]])

   * Many of my nuisance parameter uncertainties constrain post-fit. In particular:
      * JES/JER
         * %GREEN% I tried splitting these into several contributions to no avail. I also double-checked my templates and fitting methods, and tried smoothing templates to decrease the effect, again with no observed changes. This ended up being the focus of a BIG discussion in HComb, but in the end we decided to estimate these systematic impacts conservatively, using an a-posteriori method rather than relying on template morphing. My initial presentation on all of this to HComb can be found [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762838/contributions/3179852/attachments/1735769/2807459/hcomb_10_17_2018_nuisance_constraints.pdf][here]], and my presentation discussing the results of splitting the contributions among multiple sources, as well as our final a-posteriori treatment, is [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762840/contributions/3208961/attachments/1752395/2839895/hcomb_11_14_2018_a_posteriori_JEC_systematics.pdf][here]]. I'll be using a similar a-posteriori treatment to estimate impacts from parton showering, underlying event, and color reconnection uncertainties since these are also accounted for using independent event samples, which results in overconstraining of the associated nuisance parameters in template morphing.
      * Ren/Fact scale
         * %GREEN% These uncertainties are large prefit; constraints are often observed by analysts.
      * Pileup
         * %GREEN% This uncertainty is also conservative prefit; constraint can be expected.
      * Lumi
         * %GREEN% This constraint was due to correlations with other parameters and is now much less apparent as will be shown in AN v9.
      * R* scale/transfer factors
         * %GREEN% We expect these to constrain as I put in by hand a large prefit uncertainty.
      * b tagging efficiencies
         * %GREEN% I split these contributions by jet flavor (b, c, light) and observed a lessening of the constraints as will be shown in AN v9.
      * boosted electron trigger efficiency
         * %GREEN% This was measured conservatively, but the constraint still seems a bit tight even considering that. It's not too concerning, however, due to the very small impact it makes on the PoIs.
      * top pT reweighting uncertainty
         * %GREEN% We expect this to constrain as its true value should certainly be determined by fits to data. In AN v9 I will show results from theory-driven top pT reweighting, and that the constraint on that nuisance is less severe than what we observed for the older version of top pT reweighting.
      * UPDATE 5/29/2019: Much of how this looks is different now because I've changed to smoothing some systematic templates before fitting. See the slides for my April 2019 update talks listed above for more details.

   * In the boosted regime you write that you use HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT OR HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165. The egamma recommendations for these paths [1] is to use them OR'ed with some HLT_Photon. Otherwise these paths become inefficient for electrons with pt > 300 GeV. Have you checked somehow that these electrons do not play a significant role in the analysis? 
      * %GREEN% I didn't end up OR-ing with a photon trigger in that channel for three reasons. The first is that it wasn't available as one of the triggers I had in my nTuples already, and the second is that there are very few selected events, even without trigger requirements in the boosted regime, with electron pT>300 GeV (a few dozen events). The last is that I spoke with Anastasia Karavdina who performed the trigger efficiency measurement I'm using, and she investigated OR-ing with a photon trigger and found minimal impact on either the selected events or the efficiency measurements (likely because the uncertainties are rather large to begin with).

      * %GREEN% They were not originally, but have been added for AN v7.

Is "pass conversion veto" applied?
      * %GREEN% Yes, variables are extracted as detailed. Pass conversion veto IS applied and this is now listed in AN v7.
   * Effective area corrections: which values were used?
      * %GREEN% Old values. Since updated to current values listed [[https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/data/Summer16/effAreaElectrons_cone03_pfNeuHadronsAndPhotons_80X.txt][here]] in AN v7.
   * HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf has been prescaled after the 2016D period. Is this taken into account?
      * %GREEN% From Sergio (trigger contact): "In some significant fraction of the lumi after Run2016D the lowest unprescaled seed for HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf_v had a higher threshold than the HLT threshold, but the path itself was not prescaled. Therefore you will loose some efficiency at low pT. However what you are doing is not wrong, as long as you are using Andrey's scale factors ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/604912/contributions/2490011/attachments/1418869/2173471/2017.02.27_EGM_Ele25-and-Ele27-trigger-SF_v1.pdf][link]])."

   * L336-364: for all regions, apply medium ID but tight isolation?
      * %GREEN% I apply medium ID in all regions, yes, but two different sets of isolation criteria for boosted/resolved events. Boosted (type-1/type-2) events require only the "2D cut" for isolation, but resolved (type-3) events require both the 2D cut and tight PF isolation. This is also why the isolation efficiency scalefactor is only applied to type-3 events. I clarified this language for AN v7.
   * Ref. 28: provide paper ID please
      * %GREEN% recommended citation (that I've now also included in AN v7) is [[http://inspirehep.net/record/1260669][this PAS]].
   * Fig. 7: data/MC ratio increases from type-1 to type-3: why?
      * %GREEN% This was due to two things, the first being that those plots did not show any data-driven QCD contributions, which I've added in ANv7. The second was that my type-3 selection was a bit too loose (I've since changed it in AN v7 to require two medium - rather than loose - b-tagged jets). Sent along new plots to confirm.
   * L703-720: isolation SF applied only to type-3 events? loose ID SF applied to all events?
      * %GREEN% Indeed the isolation scalefactor is only applied to type 3 events because type 1 and type 2 events don't have any PF isolation requirements. For all events the medium ID SF is applied. The reference to "loose" here is a holdover/typo from a previous note version, and my language has been fixed and clarified for AN v7. In that version I also binned my plots of isolation better, and added overflow bins to all of my control plots.

   * JME POG does not perform a dedicated calibration of AK8 jets. I guess that, given that you perform a kinematic fit while allowing jet momenta to vary in magnitude, you are probably not very sensitive to a potential miscalibration of these jets. Still, have you investigated this in any way or checked with other analyses that had? Alternatively, if JEC uncertainties in the boosted topologies have a small impact on your measurement compared to other systematic uncertainties, you should be safe. If you have impact plots that show the ranking of systematic uncertainties, I'd be curious to see them. Otherwise, I think the scale of AK8 jets needs to be validated or you should check with JERC conveners if the uncertainties for AK8 jets are considered okay.
      * %GREEN% JERC conveners validated that AK8 jet uncertainties are alright. [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/jes/754.html][HN thread about this]]

   * Muon selection: muons |eta| should be < 2.4 as there are no muon detectors beyond 2.4
      * %GREEN% Done, this change will be reflected in the next iteration.
   * For the electrons your trigger intrinsically has isolation requirement. It is generally best to apply offline criteria that are tighter than the online ones, so I have some concerns about this case. Isn't there an alternative electron trigger with higher pt cut but no iso requirement? It would be good to contact the electron and trigger TOP PAG contacts.
      * %GREEN% Changed the electron trigger in the boosted channels to HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165 OR HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT after B2G Z' to boosted ttbar analysis. Anastasia Karavdina has scalefactors for this trigger configuration's efficiency measurement that I can use.
   * you also need to get your privately derived electron scale factors approved.
      * %GREEN% This wasn't the case before, but scalefactors have now been measured for all of the triggers I'm using, so my preliminary private measurement is no longer needed.
   * What corrections are applied in the control plots shown in Sec. 5.8 and 6.4? Generally good agreement for type-3 mu+jets events, but there are significant discrepancies in the other categories.
      * %GREEN% Control plots shown include all corrections listed under "systematics". Bugfixes and changes brought agreement much closer. Note that control plots don't include estimates of QCD background, and that top pT reweighting has a significant effect on the normalization of top MC, especially in boosted channels.
   * Please note that the binning of the scale factors you use should match you selection cuts, i.e. if you require lepton pt > 55 GeV, the corresponding SFs bin should be e.g. [55-60], not e.g. [50-60]. 
      * %GREEN% I double-checked the scalefactor measurements I'm using, and adjusted the boosted lepton pT cut to 50 GeV (from 55 GeV) since the bin edges are reliably at 50 GeV. The resolved channels' lepton pT cut at 30 GeV also reflects bin edges with no problem. I have a simple measurement of the b-tagging efficiency in MC for AK4 jets and I edited the histogram limits in that file to reflect the AK4 jet selection criteria.

   * what's causing the normalization issue in type-1 events?
      * %GREEN% As mentioned above this is now greatly improved in v6; control plots do not show estimates of QCD background, and top pT reweighting as well as various bugfixes have a large effect on MC normalization.
   * what's the timeline to add missing systematics (additional modeling uncertainties, etc.)?
      * %GREEN% If there are any specific systematics I'm missing that are very impactful I can implement them ASAP, but I believe I've accounted for the most dominating effects up to this point.
