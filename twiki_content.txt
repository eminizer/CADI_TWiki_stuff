---+!! Review of TOP-15-018: Measurement of the ttbar AFB at 13Tev in boosted/resolved l+jets

%TOC{title="Contents:"}%

---++ Introduction

This analysis is a template measurement of the top quark forward backward asymmetry and anomalous chromoelectric/chromomagnetic moments in boosted and resolved l+jets events using the full 2016 dataset from CMS and the LHC. Our CADI line is TOP-15-018 ([[cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines?line=TOP-15-018&tp=an&id=1550&ancode=TOP-15-018][link]]), and we have a review hypernews ([[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018.html][link]]).

   * What do you mean by "linearized"? I suppose that AFB(1) refers to some 1st-degree truncation in some sort of polynomial expansion, but in what is the expansion performed?
      * %ORANGE% Morris can answer this question in greater detail than myself, but in the analysis note the model is explained as "a linear forward-backward asymmetry (such as could be caused by several kinds of new physics that interfere with or augment the tree-level process)" (lines 56-58 in the AN) and the two papers cited are linked at [[https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.81.114004][1]] and [[https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.83.114027][2]]. Several models are presented in these papers that could extend the standard model top pair cross section, and their effects are considered in several different ways including effective field theories or effective couplings. Across the board, however, the extensions end up as some functions of the same cos(theta) we present in our paper (sometimes more clearly than others). I do not know how the exact extension we use to parameterize the asymmetric portion of the cross section (eq. 2 in the paper draft, eq. 8 in the AN) was decided on because I'm not sure of the exact correspondence of some numerical factors, but it bears a likeness to the terms in the extended cross section formulae that are dependent on cos(theta) to first order only. I think this is the best answer I can give you at the moment, but hopefully when Morris gets back from vacation he can help me understand better and we can get back to you again.

   * I think that POWHEG v1, not v2, was used for the tW sample (and only for it; v2 for all the rest), for reasons that I used to know. But I may be wrong, so please check.
      * %GREEN% You're correct about this; it totally slipped my mind. I'll make a note of this and change it in the next draft of the paper and the analysis note. Thank you for your detailed eye and I apologize for my error.

   * Figure 7: I understand that when you say "MC uncertainties" you mean the systematic uncertainties that affect the shape of the MC distributions, right? (I am asking because in the usual jargon we use that term for the statistical uncertainty due to the finite size of the MC sample.) When you say "are fully correlated statistical+systematic", what do you mean? Fully correlated between what?
      * %ORANGE% By "MC uncertainties" I am referring to the hashed grey error bars on the stacked MC template histograms in the plots; they are the total combined, post-fit, statistical+systematic uncertainties determined by fits through the combine tool, which is what I was trying to get at by saying "statistical+systematic", and by "fully correlated" I meant that the results are shown with a full treatment of the correlations of the systematic nuisance parameters across the appropriate channels as described in Section 6 of the paper (Section 9 of the AN) as well as with one another. I was trying to say "The hashed grey error bars show the total post-fit template uncertainties in each bin due to statistical as well as systematic uncertainties," but I don't like my language here either. Is there a better way to get the point across that the error bars are post-fit, not pre-fit, and that they show the total uncertainty, not just the statistical uncertainty (like what's shown in the control plots in figs. 3-5 in the paper draft)?

General comments: 

   * The first 5 pages describe the observables of the search/measurement. I  think in some places, in particular the first two pages it could be  better organized. I wonder if we can omit some of the equations... like  Eq. 6 and 7.  I assume these are taken from Ref. 16 and if the reader wants can check them. I find he theory introduction longer also taking into account the length of the experimental part of the discussion given in the paper.
      * %ORANGE% I've spoken to Morris about reorganizing this information better but he is not sure the best way to pare down the discussion and has suggested that we wait for other feedback or more explicit suggestions? We're worried about losing equations 6 and 7 for sake of clarity....

   * Throughout the paper you need to iron out the usage of jargon  expressions like "muon events", "boosted events", "dileptonic ttBar events", "semileptonic tt","templating", ... If you want to use these in the paper you need to first define at the first use case.
      * %GREEN% I've gone line-by-line through the paper and removed a lot of unnecessary jargon. Anything that I do use is defined at first use now.

   * Please add discussion on the trigger selection efficiency in each category and on how it is measured. In lines that follow 385, you state the kinematic dependent SFs are applied... But I think for such an analysis it is important to state how large are those SFs and how they change across the observables that are fitted, and overall what are the trigger efficiencies we have.
      * %GREEN% There are more details about all of this in the AN, but I tried to incorporate some key numbers in the paper draft as well. Added details on average trigger efficiency to end of "Detector" section: "The average selection efficiencies of the triggers applied to data are approximately 95\% (97\%) in the boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets channels and approximately 98\% (74\%) in the boosted (resolved) electron+jets channels." Also added details about trigger SF measurements to section on systematics: "The average values of the scalefactors applied are about 0.94 (0.96) for boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets events and about 0.98 for boosted and resolved electron+jets events. The $\mu$+jets scalefactors were measured by the Muon Physics Object Group \cite{muon_eff_twiki}. The boosted electron+jets scalefactors were measured by the Top Physics Analysis Group \cite{electron_trigger_eff_twiki} and the resolved electron+jets scalefactors were measured by analysts in the Beyond the Second Generation subgroup \cite{andrey_electron_trigger_sfs}."

   * A general comment for section 8: It would be interesting to give some quantitative range for each uncertainty source. Either the input uncertainties or the range of the systematic effect in the templates... You may also consider adding a new column in table 1. You can see how it is done in other analyses such as TOP-18-009 syst. table in the paper draft.
      * %GREEN% I added another column to the table in Section 6 of v2 of the paper and Section 9 of v9 of the analysis note to illustrate this. The column lists for each systematic the mean of the absolute values of the percent content changes observed in each affected process's template bins, quantifying the scale of each uncertainty effect.

   * Also to my taste the length of how the templates are constructed for each background source is not detailed enough. For QCD templates you derive several transfer factors. But you do not discuss their size and dependence on the template shapes. I suggest to extend on this with a  few sentences. 
      * %GREEN% The isolation and MET cuts used to define the QCD estimate sidebands are not correlated with the template observables nor with each other. To quantify the transfer factors I added at the end of the sentence describing them in  the "Background Estimation" section: "The transfer factors are applied to each of the events in the shape sidebands to renormalize the templates to the expected numbers of events in the full signal regions; their values are approximately 0.004 (0.46), 0.003 (0.35), and 0.37 (1.44) in the type-1, type-2, and type-3 signal region $\mu$(electron)+jets channels respectively."

   * Also, it is not clear if W+jets background normalizations  in Q=+ and - are independently let varied or their normalization is constrained by one nuisance.  This is important given that W+ and W- production are not symmetric.
      * %GREEN% In our current treatment there is only one scalefactor, correlated across both charges. I wanted the associated nuisance parameter to basically correct/constrain the overal W+Jets cross section measurement, so I didn't make it charge-dependent (this is also the case for Rbck scaling the other ttbar, single top, and DY+Jets background processes).

   * The results section needs to focus on more the description of the  results  rather than the technical details of the fit. So technical  details are necessary but as it is the section needs further elaboration  on the results putting them into the context of bigger picture, commenting on improvements in this analysis, telling about perspectives  of improving if possible in the future etc...
      * %GREEN% This whole section has been overhauled now.


Detailed comments:

   * L8 "top production" --> does not sound good. you can rearrange the sentence to avoid using it. And example... ".. particle physics, at the LHC top quarks are dominantly produced in pairs via the strong interaction as described by Quantum..."
      * %GREEN% Changed sentence to "In the Standard Model of particle physics, top quarks are dominantly produced in pairs at the LHC via the strong interaction as described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)."

   * L11-12: I think here you can give the proportion of the contribution from these processes (gg, qq...) to the final state.
      * %GREEN% Added "NLO QCD calculations predict approximately 6\% \qqbar, 69\% \glu, and 25\% \qg production of top pairs."

   * L14: needs a reference.
      * %GREEN% Added reference as requested.

   * Figure 2: I might have asked this before, but the bottom right plot includes also gg initial states ? Probably not because otherwise it would be much smaller given that qqbar initial state constitutes only ~10% of the total x-section. If this figure shows only the qqBar initial state cases then it should be clarified otherwise it is misleading. Additionally, these figures use Gen-level top kinematics right ? If yes, please also clarify that.
      * %GREEN% You are correct on both points: the bottom right plot does not include gg initial states, and they all use gen-level top kinematics. This is now stated in the caption.

   * Figure 2 caption: suggest to remove the last sentence it repeats what is written in the text above.
      * %GREEN% done.

   * Figure 2: Please also improve the quality of the bottom-right figure.
      * %GREEN% New CMS style version of this plot availabe in paper v2/note v9.

   * Figure 2: M--> m, also in the text. I also suggest to change it to m(ttBar)  or m_{ttBar}
      * %GREEN% Changed "M" to "m_{ttbar}" everywhere in the paper

   * L64-65 "..beyond the Standard Model processes" --> "Beyond the SM processes"
      * %GREEN% done.

   * L88: suggest not to use i, j as j is used in equation 3 for various background processes I assume. Please make the definition of j explicit too.
      * %GREEN% Changed flavor indices to a,b instead of i,j. Which definition of "j" is unclear?

   * Eq.4. Please explain this equation (and motivation for anti-symmetrisation) by connecting to Eq. 2. I assume this is related to the two parts of the x-section one having only c^2 and the other c  factors ? Just for curiosity and sanity check have you shown the distributions of y where the symmetric and antisymmetric parts sum to the original template ?
      * %GREEN% Indeed, it's the ratio of the c^2 to c portions of the cross sections; added a quick explanation of this. I have not shown that the decomposition sums to the original prediction; I'm not sure if we'd even expect that based on the generated MC? Maybe we can follow up on this in a setting where we can talk in more detail?

   * Eq.6,  c^* at the denominator
      * %GREEN% fixed.

   * - "lepton+jets final states" --> This is rather jargon. Please define it at the first use case.
      * %GREEN% first use found on line 75; changed "...from lepton+jets final states, in which..." to "...from final states containing a single lepton and several hadronic jets, called \"lepton+jets," in which..."
  
   * L 120-129: This is a good place to state what is new (other than new  data) in this analysis wrt. earlier LHC publications. Please point to  the unique features of this measurement wrt the older ones.  You may also bring the references & description of the earlier LHC measurements from lines 38-39 to here.
      * %GREEN% Added "The measurement of the \qqbar initial state top forward-backward asymmetry is the first of its kind at the LHC and can be directly compared with results from the Tevatron experiments \cite{Aaltonen:2011kc,Abazov:2007ab,Abazov:2014cca,Aaltonen:2016bqv,Aaltonen:2017efp}.  Measurements of the anomalous chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments have previously been extracted from measurements of the \ttbar spin correlations \cite{CMS:2014bea, Khachatryan:2016xws}.  This is the first measurement that relies on the \ttbar differential distributions." to the end of this paragraph.

   * L128-129: the second and third typologies are not well motivated. At this point the reader wonders why one should bother with semi- and fully- resolved tops.
      * %GREEN% Agreed, this was worded kind of funny. Changed "...are one such topology.  A second topology considers events of lower pair mass in which the decay products are partly merged.  Finally, the third category includes the lowest mass events that are fully resolved" to "...are one such topology.  A second topology considers events of lower pair mass in which the decay products are partly merged, bridging the gap between events identifiable as either fully merged or fully resolved.  Finally, the third and most populated category includes the lowest mass events that are fully resolved." This at least explains the roles of the other two selections?

   * L147: Suggest to remove the photon measurement description. It is not used in the analysis.
      * %GREEN% Done; removed "The energy of each photon is obtained from the ECAL measurement."

   * L157: repeats L148 for electron measurement
      * %GREEN% Removed "The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker."

   * L162: "Muons are identified"
      * %GREEN% "measured" --> "identified"

   * L157-148: the information given here is not well structured... I am not sure lepton momentum resolution is a critical information for this  measurement. You give trigger efficiency for muons (before you define the trigger system & triggers used in the analysis) but not for electrons...  reco+id efficiency is given only for muons and not for electrons.
      * %GREEN% Removed lepton momentum resolution information. Moved "Muons are identified in the pseudorapidity range $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers." to the paragraph above about PF. Trigger efficiencies are not given in the last paragraph of this section for both muons & electrons ("The average selection efficiencies of the triggers applied to data are approximately 95\% (97\%) in the boosted (resolved) $\mu$+jets channels and approximately 98\% (74\%) in the boosted (resolved) electron+jets channels.")
   
   * L173-174: pT_miss used in the PV selection and the ETmiss that is used in the event are not the same. One is explicitly using only tracks that  originate from a particular PV while the other is using PF objects that include neutrals as well.
      * %GREEN% Changed "The energy associated with this \ptvecmiss, called missing transverse energy or \MET," to "The energy of the negative vector sum of all PF objects, called missing transverse energy or \MET,"

   * L190: not clear what you mean with “of any muons whose singular PF candidates it shares”
      * %GREEN% Changed "...each jet has subtracted (``cleaned") from it the momenta of any electrons spatially within it and of any muons whose singular PF candidates it shares." to "...each jet has subtracted (``cleaned") from it the momenta of any leptons within it. Muons are cleaned from jets using key-based cleaning, wherein a muon's fourvector is subtracted from that of a reconstructed jet if the muon's PF candidate appears in the list of jet PF candidates, and electrons are cleaned from jets by subtracting their fourvectors from those of any reconstructed jets within spatial separation $\DR$ less than jet radius."
   
   * L202-207: suggest to move to the end of section 2 lines around 144.
      * %GREEN% This paragraph now comes right before the paragraph about PF stuff

   * L250: "Lepton candidates in the boosted (resolved) regions are required to have pT > 50(30)GeV" 50 GeV is not enough to get events beyond the  turn-on curve of the lepton trigger efficiency in particular for electrons in boosted regimes. The trigger thresholds given in lines are 50 GeV, and for electrons in particular is the case only in the presence of a high pT jet.
      * %GREEN% Bumped this cut up to 80 GeV to synchronize with trigger efficiency measurement for AN v9/paper v2

   * L253: Suggest to include a sentence  for to what "isolation" refers and why it is needed. Start with defining/justifying it for resolved  scenario then say it is modified for boosted scenario.
      * %GREEN% Added the sentence "To ensure that leptons observed in an event correspond to particles in the final decay state rather than products of hadronization, leptons are required to be isolated from nearby hadronic activity in the event." I don't want to switch around the order in which I talk about the algorithms, though, because resolved events are required to pass the 2D cut as well.

   * L258: remove "and" in "photon and..."
      * %GREEN% Done

   * L261: "any event containing" remove S
      * %GREEN% Done (also "are" --> "is")

   * L262 "dileptonic tt decays" is also jargon
      * %GREEN% Changed "...from dileptonic \ttbar decays" to "...from \ttbar decays in which both tops decay to final state leptons"

   * L264: "muon (electron) events" --> "Events with a muon(electron)..."
      * %GREEN% Done

   * Figures 3-5: need to fix the caption. "Transverse momentum (left) and pseudorapidity (right) of lepton (top) and..."  right --> middle and you  need to add Nbjet.  
      * %GREEN% Done

   * Figures 3-5: Also please remove ttBar-hadronic as it contributes super negligible and its color is indistinguishable from ttBar-dileptonic... I assume you do not use separate templates for these two. You can call it "ttBar other" in the leggend and use that label in the text to define in lines 340.
      * %GREEN% Done, this will be reflected in the next drafts (it affects a lot of plots)

   * L291: I think the reader wonders at this point about the underestimated normalization of the Type-I and Type-II events. I think we need to write a few sentence here giving reference to top_pT modelling issue.
      * %GREEN% These plots look different with the new top pT reweighting scheme; the normalization prediction is much better in the new plots in paper v2/note v9.

   * L304-320: I am not sure if the details of the Kinematic fit is  necessary, in particular the formulas showing chi2 minimization etc... Can you not give a reference and just explain in words the procedure in somewhat shorter way ? Most important here in my opinion is the performance, efficiency/purity that is given in lines  326-328.
      * %GREEN% I pared this down a lot for paper v2. I got rid of the equations and a lot of the unnecessary detail, added some references to CMS work with kinematic fitting, and focused on the performance of the method.

   * L344: "well-estimated contributions" --> not clear to what this refers ? a data control region validation ? good MC statistics ?
      * %GREEN% I removed "and well-estimated". My original point was simply that they don't suffer from the MC statistics issues that the QCD background does, nor the cross section uncertainty coupled with rather dominating contribution of the W+Jets process. "Small" handles that fine I think.

   * L341: Drell-Yan Z/g+jets, I guess you want to put a * on gamma.
      * %GREEN% yep, done!

   * L343: "The top and Z/g+jets..."  --> "The sing-letop and..." ?
      * %GREEN% Clarified my language around this.

   * L347: "less precisely estimated from MC" --> due to statistics or other reasons? Please clarify in the paper.
      * %GREEN% Changed to "because its production cross section is less precisely known from theory"

   * L352: Why not to include the M_t,lep^reco in the paper ? I think this would be a nice plot to show... I assume Figure 6 shows it only for signal ttBar events.  So M_t,lep^reco would be a complementary figure showing the background composition distributed over this observable. I think such a plot in all three categories normalized to total luminosity would be very interesting.
      * %GREEN% Replaced the plots of the btagging multiplicity in figs. 3-5 with M_t,lep^reco instead in v2 of the paper.
   
   * L356: "The QCD multijet background contribution is not well estimated in MC due to its large production cross section but low selection  efficiency,"  --> I suggest to call it low stat in MC. Because otherwise the large x-section&low selection efficiency seems to be the physics reason which is not the case.
      * %GREEN% Changed "...due to its large production cross section but low selection efficiency" to "...due to low statistics"

   * Discuss motivation for modified Lorentzian used in kinematic fit in greater detail in AN
      * %GREEN% Added more clarifying language and a reference to the paper we used to find this. It's a relativistc Breit-Wigner form representing two-body t -> Wb decays where the W resonance is correlated to the top threshold.

   * Discuss separation of MC events by production mechanism using MC truth info in greater detail in AN
      * %GREEN% Added the following subsection (called "Production Mechanism Separation") at the start of "Event Selection" in the AN: "As described in Section~\ref{sec:introduction} above, $t\bar{t}$ signal MC samples are separated not only by the nature of their decay but also by the mechanism of their production. We separate MC events into $q\bar{q}$ and $gg/qg$ categories based on MC truth information about the initial partons in the decay. We choose as the initial partons the two ``hard particles" in MC truth whose daughters are the top quark pair. Events are categorized as $gg$ when both partons have ID 21 (corresponding to gluons); $q\bar{q}$ events are those for which both parton IDs are less than 6 (corresponding to non-top quarks) and sum to zero (indicating opposite charge but matching flavor), and $qg$ events are those with exactly one parton whose ID is 21."

   * Perform a cross-check of data-driven QCD background estimation using QCD MC
      * %GREEN% This is done, please see [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/15.html][this thread on the HN]] for more details and plots.
   
   * Run with/without "Rqqbar" nuisance parameter and quantify deviation from generator value and impact on PoIs
      * %GREEN% Impact plots will be available in next version of documentation, but looking at them right now the Rqqbar nuisance gets pulled about 0.5 sigma (which means 0.5%) from its nominal value, with no constraint on its postfit uncertainty, and the impact of this nuisance on PoIs is negligible (<0.0005 for AFB).

   * Mising parton shower (ISR/FSR/hdamp), underlying event (tune), and color reconnection systematics
      * %GREEN% I've added these.

   * Results for NNLO top pT spectra could be used to derive a theory-based top pT reweighting scheme
      * %GREEN% I've done this (and it looks great!). Additional details in [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/TOP-15-018/13.html][this HN thread]].
      
   * Nuisance for pileup systematics seems to constrain a bit tightly: why might that be?
      * %GREEN% According to Andrea Marini from Higgs Combine this is to be expected because the pileup uncertainty is conservative. It is common to observe.

   * Comments from Nick on Paper draft v0
      * Eqn 12: I assume that you do not run into any issues with -ve yields here? Are the yields in the regions A, B and C sufficient to avoid that?
         * %GREEN% Correct, we don’t have issues with negative yields because the yields in the A, B, and C regions are indeed sufficient. I tuned the MET cuts in each channel partially to solve this problem!
      * In Section 6 you could probably mention the constraints on these nuisance parameters - eg are they assumed to be log-normal / Gaussian etc ...? It could be added to Table 1 
         * %GREEN% I mention the nuisance constraints briefly in Section 7 (lines 435-438), but I can definitely add them to the Table as well.
      * Fig 9 is very nice - I don't often see this in so much detail however, I am confused perhaps about 1 thing. Are you using here directly the measured value of the parameter as the "test-statistic" ? Often the neyman construction involves using the likelihood outcomes to order the results (actually this is more the Feldman-cousins way). Maybe I am misreading those plots.
         * %GREEN% I gave a presentation in a StatComm meeting about this ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762830/contributions/3170892/attachments/1730085/2795956/statcomm_10_8_2018_neyman_and_gof.pdf][link]]) that has more details than I can include here.
   * From statistics questionnaire: after unblinding I will need to return with something about Goodness of Fit.
      * %GREEN% I've run Goodness of Fit tests using the KS algorithm per-channel. Version 9 of the AN explains and lists those results with plots and in a table of p-values. I presented these results before my datacard greenlight at a Higgs Combine meeting on April 17th ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/788727/contributions/3401374/attachments/1831680/2999825/higgs_combine_4_17_2019_fitting_details.pdf][slides]])

   * Many of my nuisance parameter uncertainties constrain post-fit. In particular:
      * JES/JER
         * %GREEN% I tried splitting these into several contributions to no avail. I also double-checked my templates and fitting methods, and tried smoothing templates to decrease the effect, again with no observed changes. This ended up being the focus of a BIG discussion in HComb, but in the end we decided to estimate these systematic impacts conservatively, using an a-posteriori method rather than relying on template morphing. My initial presentation on all of this to HComb can be found [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762838/contributions/3179852/attachments/1735769/2807459/hcomb_10_17_2018_nuisance_constraints.pdf][here]], and my presentation discussing the results of splitting the contributions among multiple sources, as well as our final a-posteriori treatment, is [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/762840/contributions/3208961/attachments/1752395/2839895/hcomb_11_14_2018_a_posteriori_JEC_systematics.pdf][here]]. I'll be using a similar a-posteriori treatment to estimate impacts from parton showering, underlying event, and color reconnection uncertainties since these are also accounted for using independent event samples, which results in overconstraining of the associated nuisance parameters in template morphing.
      * Ren/Fact scale
         * %GREEN% These uncertainties are large prefit; constraints are often observed by analysts.
      * Pileup
         * %GREEN% This uncertainty is also conservative prefit; constraint can be expected.
      * Lumi
         * %GREEN% This constraint was due to correlations with other parameters and is now much less apparent as will be shown in AN v9.
      * R* scale/transfer factors
         * %GREEN% We expect these to constrain as I put in by hand a large prefit uncertainty.
      * b tagging efficiencies
         * %GREEN% I split these contributions by jet flavor (b, c, light) and observed a lessening of the constraints as will be shown in AN v9.
      * boosted electron trigger efficiency
         * %GREEN% This was measured conservatively, but the constraint still seems a bit tight even considering that. It's not too concerning, however, due to the very small impact it makes on the PoIs.
      * top pT reweighting uncertainty
         * %GREEN% We expect this to constrain as its true value should certainly be determined by fits to data. In AN v9 I will show results from theory-driven top pT reweighting, and that the constraint on that nuisance is less severe than what we observed for the older version of top pT reweighting.
      * UPDATE 5/29/2019: Much of how this looks is different now because I've changed to smoothing some systematic templates before fitting. See the slides for my April 2019 update talks listed above for more details.

   * In the boosted regime you write that you use HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT OR HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165. The egamma recommendations for these paths [1] is to use them OR'ed with some HLT_Photon. Otherwise these paths become inefficient for electrons with pt > 300 GeV. Have you checked somehow that these electrons do not play a significant role in the analysis? 
      * %GREEN% I didn't end up OR-ing with a photon trigger in that channel for three reasons. The first is that it wasn't available as one of the triggers I had in my nTuples already, and the second is that there are very few selected events, even without trigger requirements in the boosted regime, with electron pT>300 GeV (a few dozen events). The last is that I spoke with Anastasia Karavdina who performed the trigger efficiency measurement I'm using, and she investigated OR-ing with a photon trigger and found minimal impact on either the selected events or the efficiency measurements (likely because the uncertainties are rather large to begin with).

      * %GREEN% done
   * How is ID applied? By hand or via value maps?
      * %GREEN% I apply the ID "by hand" to explicitly bypass the isolation requirements.
   * Are impact parameter cuts applied?
      * %GREEN% They were not originally, but have been added for AN v7.
   * Are you using high-pT-specific ID?
      * %GREEN% I decided against using it to sychronize with the boosted electron trigger efficiency selection.
   * Please add estimated QCD contribution to control plots
      * %GREEN% Added in AN v7
   * Is your selection synchronized with the boosted trigger efficiency measurement selection (AN-2016/255)?
      * %GREEN% As of AN v9, it finally will be completely.
   * Are ID variables extracted as listed [[https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/master/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/plugins/cuts][here]] and simplified [[https://github.com/ikrav/EgammaWork/blob/ntupler_and_VID_demos_8.0.3/ElectronNtupler/plugins/SimpleElectronNtupler.cc][here]]? Is "pass conversion veto" applied?
      * %GREEN% Yes, variables are extracted as detailed. Pass conversion veto IS applied and this is now listed in AN v7.
   * Effective area corrections: which values were used?
      * %GREEN% Old values. Since updated to current values listed [[https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/data/Summer16/effAreaElectrons_cone03_pfNeuHadronsAndPhotons_80X.txt][here]] in AN v7.
   * HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf has been prescaled after the 2016D period. Is this taken into account?
      * %GREEN% From Sergio (trigger contact): "In some significant fraction of the lumi after Run2016D the lowest unprescaled seed for HLT_Ele27_WPTight_Gsf_v had a higher threshold than the HLT threshold, but the path itself was not prescaled. Therefore you will loose some efficiency at low pT. However what you are doing is not wrong, as long as you are using Andrey's scale factors ([[https://indico.cern.ch/event/604912/contributions/2490011/attachments/1418869/2173471/2017.02.27_EGM_Ele25-and-Ele27-trigger-SF_v1.pdf][link]])."

   * L325-327: add reference
      * %GREEN% I am also not sure what to cite for my trigger choices? Mohsen says it's not a big deal, it just might come up with the ARC.
   * L336-364: for all regions, apply medium ID but tight isolation?
      * %GREEN% I apply medium ID in all regions, yes, but two different sets of isolation criteria for boosted/resolved events. Boosted (type-1/type-2) events require only the "2D cut" for isolation, but resolved (type-3) events require both the 2D cut and tight PF isolation. This is also why the isolation efficiency scalefactor is only applied to type-3 events. I clarified this language for AN v7.
   * Ref. 28: provide paper ID please
      * %GREEN% recommended citation (that I've now also included in AN v7) is [[http://inspirehep.net/record/1260669][this PAS]].
   * Fig. 7: data/MC ratio increases from type-1 to type-3: why?
      * %GREEN% This was due to two things, the first being that those plots did not show any data-driven QCD contributions, which I've added in ANv7. The second was that my type-3 selection was a bit too loose (I've since changed it in AN v7 to require two medium - rather than loose - b-tagged jets). Sent along new plots to confirm.
   * L703-720: isolation SF applied only to type-3 events? loose ID SF applied to all events?
      * %GREEN% Indeed the isolation scalefactor is only applied to type 3 events because type 1 and type 2 events don't have any PF isolation requirements. For all events the medium ID SF is applied. The reference to "loose" here is a holdover/typo from a previous note version, and my language has been fixed and clarified for AN v7. In that version I also binned my plots of isolation better, and added overflow bins to all of my control plots.

      * %GREEN% I added this requirement for AN v7
   * JME POG does not perform a dedicated calibration of AK8 jets. I guess that, given that you perform a kinematic fit while allowing jet momenta to vary in magnitude, you are probably not very sensitive to a potential miscalibration of these jets. Still, have you investigated this in any way or checked with other analyses that had? Alternatively, if JEC uncertainties in the boosted topologies have a small impact on your measurement compared to other systematic uncertainties, you should be safe. If you have impact plots that show the ranking of systematic uncertainties, I'd be curious to see them. Otherwise, I think the scale of AK8 jets needs to be validated or you should check with JERC conveners if the uncertainties for AK8 jets are considered okay.
      * %GREEN% JERC conveners validated that AK8 jet uncertainties are alright. [[https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/jes/754.html][HN thread about this]]

   * Muon selection: muons |eta| should be < 2.4 as there are no muon detectors beyond 2.4
      * %GREEN% Done, this change will be reflected in the next iteration.
   * For the electrons your trigger intrinsically has isolation requirement. It is generally best to apply offline criteria that are tighter than the online ones, so I have some concerns about this case. Isn't there an alternative electron trigger with higher pt cut but no iso requirement? It would be good to contact the electron and trigger TOP PAG contacts.
      * %GREEN% Changed the electron trigger in the boosted channels to HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165 OR HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT after B2G Z' to boosted ttbar analysis. Anastasia Karavdina has scalefactors for this trigger configuration's efficiency measurement that I can use.
   * you also need to get your privately derived electron scale factors approved.
      * %GREEN% This wasn't the case before, but scalefactors have now been measured for all of the triggers I'm using, so my preliminary private measurement is no longer needed.
   * What corrections are applied in the control plots shown in Sec. 5.8 and 6.4? Generally good agreement for type-3 mu+jets events, but there are significant discrepancies in the other categories.
      * %GREEN% Control plots shown include all corrections listed under "systematics". Bugfixes and changes brought agreement much closer. Note that control plots don't include estimates of QCD background, and that top pT reweighting has a significant effect on the normalization of top MC, especially in boosted channels.
   * Please note that the binning of the scale factors you use should match you selection cuts, i.e. if you require lepton pt > 55 GeV, the corresponding SFs bin should be e.g. [55-60], not e.g. [50-60]. 
      * %GREEN% I double-checked the scalefactor measurements I'm using, and adjusted the boosted lepton pT cut to 50 GeV (from 55 GeV) since the bin edges are reliably at 50 GeV. The resolved channels' lepton pT cut at 30 GeV also reflects bin edges with no problem. I have a simple measurement of the b-tagging efficiency in MC for AK4 jets and I edited the histogram limits in that file to reflect the AK4 jet selection criteria.

   * what's causing the normalization issue in type-1 events?
      * %GREEN% As mentioned above this is now greatly improved in v6; control plots do not show estimates of QCD background, and top pT reweighting as well as various bugfixes have a large effect on MC normalization.
   * what's the timeline to add missing systematics (additional modeling uncertainties, etc.)?
      * %GREEN% If there are any specific systematics I'm missing that are very impactful I can implement them ASAP, but I believe I've accounted for the most dominating effects up to this point.
